There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Borderline loss of vertebral body height in of the mid thoracic vertebrae are likely within the range for normal. IMPRESSION: A rounded retrocardiac opacity has somewhat distinct borders and may represent a hiatus hernia or an atypical appearance for pneumonia, however a more focal lesion cannot be excluded. CT chest may be helpful to clarify, alternatively followup with repeat chest radiograph in weeks following completion of treatment to re-evaluate would be recommended.

" EXAMINATION: CHEST (PORTABLE AP INDICATION: year old man with effusion s/p chest tube // Interval change? COMPARISON: Chest-ray from at FINDINGS: The tube overlying the upper mediastinum raises the question of interval placement of a tracheostomy tube. Linear density over the mediastinum in the midline likely represents an NG tube. On today's study, due to underpenetration, this is traced only to the level of the diaphragm. It may very well course beyond that, but be obscured by underpenetration. A left subclavian central line and right subclavian PICC line are again noted. The tips are not well delineated in a partially obscured by the overlying right pleural drain, but both appear to lie in the region of the SVC/RA junction. No pneumothorax is detected. Again seen are low inspiratory volumes, stable prominence the cardiomediastinal silhouette, CHF, moderate bilateral pleural effusions each with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, all similar to the prior study. Again seen is tubing in the region the right hilum, apparently a right-sided drain. IMPRESSION: Question interval placement of tracheostomy tube. Otherwise, overall similar to the prior study.

HISTORY: An -year-old woman with a new right chest tube. Evaluate for pneumothorax. IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to : New pleural tube projects over the right upper chest. From single frontal view, I cannot tell how much of it is intrathoracic. It has three acute folds, which may be a function or visual foreshortening rathern than real, any one of which could be occlusive. The lower right chest has the appearance of an anterior pneumothorax, similarly difficult to assess without a lateral view. The indwelling right pleural drain in the lower chest is unchanged in position, with a suggestion that only a short segment of it is intrathoracic. The extent of right pleural thickening or loculated fluid has decreased in the upper chest a little since : a.m. following insertion of the second right pleural drain. Heart size is normal. Left lung is clear. 

"
" AP CHEST, : A.M., HISTORY: Empyema followup. IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to : The lower component of pleural fluid loculation in the right hemithorax decreased dramatically following insertion of the right pigtail pleural drainage catheter, and has not changed since . The superior component; however, which is probably mostly posterior, is slightly larger today than it was on or . There is no pneumothorax. The right pleural drainage catheter could have a relatively short intrathoracic excursion given that the most distal loop appears to project outside the intercostal plane. Lateral view would be helpful in determining the extent of intrathoracic tubing. Considerable atelectasis is expected at the base of the right lung and this would obscure consolidation there. The left lung is entirely clear. Heart size is normal. Small loculations of pleural air in the right upper chest laterally have not changed appreciably since . 

"
" PORTABLE CHEST, COMPARISON: . FINDINGS: Right pigtail pleural catheter is similar in position to the prior radiograph.

The loops of the right upper pleural drainage catheter appear less acute. The prior indwelling lower pleural drain is unchanged, with a very small intrathoracic course, and stable small associated pleural loculation or thickening. There is still the suggestion of pneumothorax in the lower hemithorax, some subpulmonic, probably the great bulk in the anterior chest. Lateral view is strongly recommended to assess that. Atelectasis is still quite substantial in the right lower lobe. Left lung and left pleural space are essentially clear and the heart size is normal. 

"
" HISTORY: Empyema followup.

FINDINGS: Slightly rotated positioning. An ET tube is present, tip approximately . cm above the carina. An NG tube an NG type tube is present, tip overlying the gastric fundus, beneath the diaphragm. An IABP is present, extending from an inferior approach. The aortic knob itself is not well-defined, but the radiopaque tip probably lies at or immediately below the lower edge of the aortic knob. There are dense, confluent opacities in both upper zones, extending into the mid/ lower zones, but with sparing of both lung bases. The degree of confluence is greater on the left. No effusion is identified. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is at the upper limits of normal, but not frankly enlarged. No pneumothorax is detected. IMPRESSION: . ET and NG tubes, as described. . IABP radiopaque tip probably lies at or immediately below the inferior edge of the aortic knob. . Dense left-greater-than-right opacities, with upper lobe predominance and sparing of the bases. While this could represent an atypical distribution of CHF, including changes associated with valve dysfunction, in the appropriate clinical setting, the upper lobe predominance would also raise the question of infectious or inflammatory etiologies.

" EXAMINATION: CHEST (PORTABLE AP INDICATION: year old man with STEMI // assess ET tube and interval change TECHNIQUE: AP supine portable view COMPARISON: CHEST-RAY FROM . AT : FINDINGS: The ET tube lies approximately . cm above the carina, with its tip at the level of the mid clavicular heads, similar to the prior film. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, curling in the expected location of the gastric fundus, also similar to prior. An intra-aortic balloon pump is present. It appears to lie more distal in the descending aorta than on the prior film. Although the aortic knob is not well delineated, the radiopaque tip of the inferior bone pump appears to lie slightly inferior to the expected site of the inferior edge of aortic knob, nominal in alignment. An inferior approach catheter is present. This likely represents a Swan-Ganz catheter, with tip superimposed over the main pulmonary artery. A large caliber tube or catheter lies immediately to the right of midline, extending from inferior to overlie the upper/mid thoracic spine. Again seen are opacities in both lungs, most pronounced in the upper lobes, where either fluid or pleural parenchymal scarring may also be present. On the left, there is dense opacity throughout the upper and mid zones. On the right, there are opacities in a similar distribution, but these do not appear is density appearance. Compared to a semi supine film from very early the same-day (just after midnight, there appears to been some leftward shift of the mediastinum, raising the question of volume loss in the left lung. The left hemidiaphragm canal appears tented and the diaphragm is also partially obscured medially. This appearance is similar to the film from : a.m.. IMPRESSION: . ET tube tip at level of mid clavicular heads, approximately . cm above the carina, essentially unchanged. . Interval distal retraction of the radiopaque portion of the intra-aortic balloon pump. I suspect that the tip now lies very slightly below the inferior edge of the aortic knob, nominal in position. . Findings suggestive of left-sided volume loss, with leftward shift of mediastinum. . Opacities in both lungs, within upper zone predominance and relative sparing of the bases. This is similar to multiple prior films, though the difference in degree of opacity -- much denser on the left-- has progressed compared with the initial film. The reason for this is uncertain. While it could be technical, it may also be accentuated by atelectasis/volume loss. . Increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, has also progressed since the initial film. This may be accentuated by supine positioning.

" HISTORY: Glioblastoma with bacterial meningitis and hypoxia. FINDINGS: In comparison with study of , there are substantially lower lung volumes, which may account for much of the apparent increase in transverse diameter of the heart. No evidence of vascular congestion. There is some retrocardiac opacification medially. It is unclear how much of this could represent some volume loss or even consolidation in the lower lobe and how much could merely be a manifestation of low lung volumes and the supine portable technique. If clinically possible, lateral view would be extremely helpful. The right IJ catheter extends to about the level of the cavoatrial junction or possibly in the upper portion of the right atrium itself. 

"
" HISTORY: Brain tumor with spiking fevers. FINDINGS: In comparison with study of , the patient has taken a much better inspiration. Again there is an area of increased opacification in the retrocardiac region with poor definition of the descending aorta. Although this could merely reflect atelectasis, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.

I cannot identify it on the lateral. Loss of volume in the right lung is attributable to right upper lobectomy and obscuration of the right heart border and anterior aspect of the right hemidiaphragm could be due to anatomic rearrangement stemming from surgery. Upper lungs are clear. The heart is normal size. Thoracic aorta is mildly dilated and very tortuous. There is no pleural effusion. I see no explanation for decreased breath sounds in the left lower chest, except the patient has moderately extensive emphysema generally. There is suggestion of additional small lung nodules in the left lower lobe, projecting over the descending thoracic aorta, and perhaps in one of the upper lobes retrosternally on the lateral view projecting just superior to the ascending thoracic aorta.

" PORTABLE AP CHEST-RAY INDICATION: Patient with intubation, evaluation for ETT placement. COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: ET tube ends . cm above the carina. NG tube is in the stomach. The lungs are otherwise clear. Elevation of right hemidiaphragm is mild. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal. CONCLUSION: . Lines and tubes are in adequate position. . The rest of the exam is unremarkable. 

"
" INDICATION: -year-old with chest pain. TECHNIQUE: Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained. COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: The lungs are clear, and the cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are normal. There is no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax. IMPRESSION: No acute cardiothoracic process. 

"
" PORTABLE CHEST OF COMPARISON: radiograph. FINDINGS: There has been interval extubation and improved lung volumes compared to the recent radiograph. Bibasilar atelectasis has nearly resolved with residual patchy atelectasis remaining in the right lower lobe and only minimal residual linear atelectasis in the left lower lobe. Apparent rightward deviation of the trachea is likely due to mild patient rotation and curvature of the spine, as there is no evidence of a discrete paratracheal mass on recent neck CTA of . Cardiac silhouette is stable in size. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 

"
" CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON COMPARISON: Prior chest radiograph from earlier same day. CLINICAL HISTORY: Transfer from outside hospital with intubation, assess position of tube. FINDINGS: Portable supine AP view of the chest provided demonstrates an endotracheal tube with tip positioned approximately . cm above the carina. The NG tube courses into the left upper abdomen. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Heart and mediastinal contour appears grossly unremarkable. The bony structures appear intact. IMPRESSION: Appropriately positioned ET and NG tubes. Bibasilar atelectasis. 

"
" INDICATION: -year-old female intubated for head bleed, who presents for evaluation of pneumonia. COMPARISONS: Chest radiographs from . TECHNIQUE: Single AP portable exam on the chest. FINDINGS: The ET tube terminates approximately . cm from the carina. The NG tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of view of the film. There has been interval worsening of the right linear opacification likely secondary to atelectasis. No pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion is seen. The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal. There is mild cardiomegaly, stable compared to the preior exam. IMPRESSION: Slight interval worsening of right lower lung atelectasis.
