Brief Hospital Course: A/P: yo F with pancreatic cancer on CD Gemcitabine with several weeks of LE swelling. Following admission, patient underwent work-up for lower extremity edema. Ultrasound of the lower extremities was performed and negative for DVT. CT of her abdomen and pelvis revealedC compression by obstructed afferent loop due to necrotic adenocarcinoma in tail of the pancreas. EGD was performed but notenable to stent across obstruction. Following discussion with patient and family regarding pursuing comfort measures care versus surgical decompression, patient opted to undergo surgical intervention. Enteroenterostomy of afferent pancreaticobiliary drainage limb was performed, along with placement of a feeding jejunostomy tube into the afferent limb distal to the stomach. C filter was placed on the firt post-operative day. Her post-operative course was complicated by hypothermia, hyponatremia, and hypoglycemia. She was treated with a -day course of peri-operative prophylactic anbtibiotics. She was transferred back to the Oncology service on post-op day . The following is an outline of her ongoing medical issues: . Hyponatremia: Serum sodium nadired at in the post-operative course. Calculated FeNa . points to effective intravascular volume depletion. She was treated with normal saline, NaCl tablets and free water restriction. On day of discharge, her sodium serum was stable at . . Generalized anarsarca: She developed new pleural effusions, ascites, and generalized anasarca in the post-operative period, likely the result of her hypoalbuminemia. She also had some intermittent and persitent lower extremity edema post-operatively, likely the result of dependent edema. She was treated with albumin infusion with concomitant lasix days with good result. Leg edema was complicated by areas of stage II skin breakdown over her distal lower extremities. Leg edema improved with elevation of her extremities. . Thrombocytopenia - Patient's platelets trended down from > on admission to . Lovenox was temporarily discontinued and heparin dependent antibody was sent. Heparin dependent antibody returned with negative result. A second test was pending at the time of discharge, and Lovenox was resumed. . Pancreatic insufficiency - Patient is s/p whipple with insulin dependence. Prior to her surgical intervention, she was found unresponsive with a blood glucose of ; it is unknown how long she had been hypoglycemic. This event occurred after receiving Lantus units. Her mental status improved with D infusion. All insulin was discontinued following this event. She continued to have interval hypoglycemia post-operatively. Following transfer back to the Oncology service, her blood glucoses were persistently between -, and she was restarted on a Humalog sliding scale. Prior to discharge, Diabetes was consulted and recommended that she resume Lantus units qAM plus the prescribed sliding scale. . Pancreatic cancer - Further chemotherapy deferred until completion of wound healing and pending further discussion with her Oncologist. . . Pain control - She was managed with PRN Dilaudid in the peri-operative period. She was later transitioned to her previous regimen of MScontin once able to swallow pills. . Prophylaxis - Patient with hypercoagulable state with underlying malignancy. Given her minimal subcutaneous tissue for medication administration, she was maintained on Lovenox at prophylaxis dosing. Lovenox was temporarily held with concern for HIT but was resumed prior to discharge. She is was maintained on PPI as GI prophylaxis and Acyclovir as HSV prophylaxis given her immunocompromised status. . FEN - Patient is chronically malnourished. During her surgical procedure, placement of a feeding jejunostomy tube into the afferent limb distal to the stomach was accomplished. Per recommendations from Nutrition consultant, she was titrated to tube feed goal of full-strength Impact at cc/hour. She also continues to tolerate a regular PO diet. . Skin breakdown: Wound care consultant recommends foam dressing to partial-thickness breakdown of coccyx with change q days. She also has small areas of skin breakdown over distal lower extremities, secondary to profound edema. Recommend Adaptic non-adherent dressing, covered with dry gauze and Kerlex wrap, no tape on skin. Recommend daily changes to lower extremity dressing.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a yo M with 's Syndrome who initially presented to an OSH with aspiration PNA requiring intubation. Aspiration PNA - The patient arrived from the OSH with bilateral aspiration and mrsa pneumonia extubated (s/p days on the ventilator. The patient was oxygenating well on % FM on admission. That evening, he became acutely agitated asking for water. He dropped his sats to the upper 's and required intubation. He was initally treated with vanco/clindamycin for aspiration and MRSA pneumonia. He was switched to vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl to broaden coverage. He continued to be difficult to oxygenate and was switched to pressure control ventilation. On hospital day , the patient's respiratory rate was elevated and was unable to maintain O sats >%. We paralyzed him with cisatracurium to decrease his respiratory rate and increase his oxygenation. He continued to spike fevers to and became acutely hypotensive. He was started on levophed to maintain a MAP > and his antibiotics were changed to vanco/meropenem. Because he had a history of meropenem resistent organisms, he was switched back to vanco/cefepime/flagyl. He was quickly weaned off the levophed. Sputum samples grew staph aureus and pseudomonas. We performed a CT scan of his torso and sinuses to look for further sources of infection given his ongoing fevers; he was found to have multifocal pneumonia. Over the course of the week, he progressed to ARDS and developed fibrosis of his lungs. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to wean off the ventilator, his family made the decision to provide comfort measures only. He was extubated on with his family members present, and he expired within the next hours. The attending was notified, and the family agreed to a post-mortem examination. Diabetes Mellitus - The patient was maintained on an insulin drip during his ICU course. Conjunctivitis - The patient was admitted with bilateral conjunctivitis with purulent drainage (R>L. He was treated with vanco and erythromycin topical ointment ( day course. He was seen by opthalmology who felt his eyes were irriated from drying. His eyes were taped shut while paralyzed/sedated. Diabetes Insipidus - The patient was continued on desmopressin (per home regimen. On the evening of admission his Na rose to and he was started on increasing free water boluses q hrs with his tube feeds. This was altered to maintain a Na within normal limits. Hypothyroidism - He was switched to an equivalent dose of levothyroxine (from PO on admission. Anxiety/Depression - Continued Seroquel. ?Epilepsy - It was unclear if the patient had been on dilantin at the time of admission. He had been on it at some point in the past. Given that his seizures seemed to occur in the settings of hypoxia (previous pneumonias and hypoglycemia, we felt we should start dilantin given his predisposition to those conditions in his current state.

Brief Hospital Course: wrote: Mr is a -year old man with a history of significant abdominal infectious issues after complications of embolization of pancreaticoduodenal artery for GI bleed in /. Currently, he is readmitted with fevers, rigors and vomiting after a recent definitive surgery for treatment of his abdominal issues. Worrisome for etiology of his current symptoms is a recurrent abdominal process, particularly in the setting of the peri-drain purulence. To further assess this will require some microbiological data and imaging to clarify his post-procedural abdomen. Also of concern is potential for pneumonia--despite relatively negative symptoms--likely due to aspiration for tube feeds. This is a rather likely etiology, particularly given the time frame he outlines; although his cognitive status is intact, a supine position with nocturnal tube feeds may have predisposed to aspiration. Third, further/Jtube dysfunction may account for his symptoms. Lastly, he has a prominent murmur on exam. If fever or infectious symptoms persist or worsen, or if a blood culture is positive, investigation for endocarditis (possibly from hematogenous seeding during recent procedures is warranted with echocardiography. For antibiotic coverage, would s suggest continuing with current antibiotics. This may be narrowed as more data is collected, particularly to cover aspiration pneumonitis, but given prior highly resistant organisms, antibiotics are appropriate coverage. After being admitted to the ICU, he responded toF and antibiotics and was transferred to the floor the next day. CV:Monitor blood pressures, bolusF for hypotension. Resp:WNL GI: There was a small area along the incision that was draining minimal serous fluid. Nutrition: Tubefeeding: jevity . Full strength; Sips.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST : AM IMPRESSION: . Large cavitary lesion within the right lower lobe. Comparison with outside hospital studies would be helpful in evaluation of evolution of this process. Given highly elevated white blood count, an infectious process is highly favored and necrotic/abscess transformation of focal pneumonia is likely. A second differential diagnosis includes TB. A similar appearance has been described post- radiation of an intraparenchymal tumor focus, however, I believe, is much less likely. . Total body volume overload with large left pleural effusion and moderate right effusion, ascites, and anasarca. . Right mastectomy and fiducial markers in the left breast (oncologic history currently unknown.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP : AM IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: There is a large ring shadow in the right mid lung, from to as much as cm in diameter, with perimeter consolidation suggesting a lung abscess or cavitary pneumonia, less likely malignancy. Small left and even smaller right pleural effusions are dependent. Consolidation at the base of the left lung could be atelectasis or pneumonia. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax. ET tube tip is no more than mm from the carina. Left PIC catheter ends in the upper right atrium. . RUQ u/s : IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of the gallbladder with a small gallstone but no signs of cholecystitis. No biliary dilatation. Trace of ascites and right pleural effusion as seen before. . CXR : FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube has been removed. There is substantial increase to now large bilateral effusions. There is new mild pulmonary edema. Cavitary lesion within the superior segment of the right lower lobe is no longer appreciated; however, opacity within the right upper lobe has increased in size. No pneumothorax is detected. IMPRESSION: . New mild pulmonary edema and significant increase in pleural effusions. . Increase in right upper lobe opacity since previous study, in which developing pneumonia is in the differential. Repeat CT scan : . Mixed response with decreased size of right lower lobe cavitary lesion but appearance of new nodular focus within the left lower lobe and new patchy lingular/middle lobe consolidations. Given the mixed response to treatment, a multiorganism process should be considered. . Bilateral moderate-to-large pleural effusions with associated relaxation atelectasis. .

Brief Hospital Course: year old female with COPD, ETOH hepatitis who presented as a transfer from with a lung abscess. Hospital course by problem: . . Mechanical ventilation: The patient was intubated at the OSH reportedly for transfer, and was easily extubated after obtaining a chest CT in the MICU. She was transitioned to L NC before being called out the floor the day after admission. She was weened to room air. . . Cavitary lung lesion: Likely aspiration given history of alcoholism and failed swallow study. No real risk factors for hospital acquired pathogens. Had been afebrile since arrival from OSH. At the OSH the patient had cc pleural effusion tapped at OSH reportedly transudative in nature without evidence of infection, cytology negative. While intubated in the ICU, the patient underwent bronchoscopy, without sampling of abcess. Sputum cultures positive for yeast, likely contaminant, otherwise unremarkable, AFB negative . She was seen by thorasic surgery, and it was felt that no surgical intervention needed for now, with a planned f/u CT scan on . After being called out from ICU, the patient's vanc/zosyn was switched to levo/clinda. She remained afebrile with a resolving WBC count. As discussed below, the patient elected to eat despite failed swallow study and risk of aspiration. The following day she had rise of WBC to , new hypoxia requiring NRB, and new fever. She was switched to vanc/zosyn and cipro for pseudamonas double coverage. Her oxygenation improved also with mg lasix given mild pulmonary edema on CXR. She was reweened off O and vanc/zosyn/cipro will be continued for one month from . She had a repeat CT scan on , which showed improvement in size of abcess in RLL, but did show new nodular focues and patchy changes consistent with aspiration. The patient remained on room air, afebrile, and with a normal WBC count. When blood cultures showed VRE, the patient was switched from vanc to linezolid. She should complete antibiotics on . She will require follow up with pulmonolgy and repeat CT scan after that time. . VRE Bacteremia: Patient grew out blood cultures on consecutive days with VRE. She was started on linezolid on . since that time she has remained afebrile and had a normal WBC. Her PICC was removed, and tip was culture negative. Her PICC has been replaced. . . Hypotension: The patient was put on a very low dose of levophed during transfer, though she had no signs of active sepsis, was afebrile, and had no leukocytosis. Her levophed was weaned off over the first night and she remained hemodynamically stable. . Choledocholithiaisis noted on OSH abdominal US: The patient's abdominal exam was benign and she had a repeat abdominal US in the MICU which showed no evidence of choledocholithiasis. Her LFTs were trended which showed continued to rise, although the patient denied abdominal pain. A repeat RUQ u/s in the setting of her jump in WBC to and rise in LFTs was unremarkable. Her LFTs on time of discharge are normal and she is without abdominal pain. Chest CT showed diffuse pancreatic calcification and ductal dilitation, and she will require GI follow up after stabilization of current medical issues. . COPD: She was started on solumedrol qAM at the OSH for possible COPD flare given her hypoxia and significant smoking history. This was tapered quickly upon transfer. She was continued on ipratropium nebs, and discharged on spiriva. Albuter was avoided given MAT. . MAT: Patient with tachycardia to s, EKG showing multifocal atrial tachycardia in setting of low Mg and K+. Her BP was stable and she was asymptomatic. Her electrolytes were repleted and she was started on diltiazem for rate control to good deffect. Her blood pressure became too low when doses were increased in attempts for improved control. . Alcoholism: There is no evidence of alcohol withdrawl, and Valium PRN CIWA was discontinued. Patient admits to having a drinking problem, and social work was consulted. . Dysphagia: Patient failed video swallow study here and . Explained to patient options of feeding tube vs. eating with risk of continued aspiration. Explained that risk of aspiration would be reduced given her the risk of aspiration given her swallowing dysfunction. Patient elected to eat, despite high potential to further aspirate/repsiratory distress. Patient demonstrated understanding of risks.

Global cardiovascular risk reduction strategies to meet recommended targets Brief Hospital Course: . CORONARIES: Mrs was found to have significant vessel disease at the outside hospital and was transferred to for PCI. She developed chest pain and hypotension en route to which resolved without intervention prior to arrival. PCI was initally on hold given pts poor resp status, however resp status improved with lasix and she underwent LMCA stenting with DES using tandem heart support. She was transferred to the CCU after stenting for further montioring, however did well and was quickly transferred to the cardiology floor. She was also maintained on aspirin, Imdur, heparin and high dose statin. Plavix was started after intervention and will be continued at mg for week, then pt will require lifelong treatment of mg/day. High dose aspirin mg should be maintained for at least month but thereafter may be down titrated to mg daily if necessary. . Systolic heart failure/volume overload: Mrs has a baseline EF of %, was admitted in significant respiratory distress and crackles on exam. She underwent diuresis with lasix gtt and respiratory status improved with diuresis. She was also continued on metoprolol at a decreased dose ( mg secondary to concern for her hypotension on admission. . HYPOTENSION: Pt was hypotensive on transport to the hospital, however pressures stabilized in the low s on arrival to the hospital. We also considerd septic physiology given leukocytosis, ? PNA on CXR, positive blood cxs growing gram - staph, and pt was started on vanc/levofloxicin. Vancomycin was discontinued after surveillance cultures remained negative after hrs. Blood pressures stabilized and remained normotensive through duration of hospital stay. . LEUKOCYTOSIS: Likely due to PNA, therefore pt was treated for HCAP. While bacteremia was intially considered, vancomycin was dc'd after hrs of negative cultures. She was continued on a day course of levofloxicin for CAP pneumonia. . CKD: Worsening renal function during this admission, with FeNa< concerning for pre-renal etiology. Initially attributed to aggresive lasix diuresis, given that renal function improved after discontinuation of diuresis, however renal function worsened again after cath, raising concern for contrast-related nephropathy given that the pt received contrast day prior at OSH.

FINDINGS: Interval removal of the endotracheal tube. Right central venous catheter is unchanged. Moderate pleural effusion on the left with surrounding atelectasis appears worse compared to the prior study. Atelectatic changes seen within the right base are stable. Lungs are otherwise clear with no evidence of focal consolidation. No pneumothorax. IMPRESSION: Moderate left pleural effusion and surrounding atelectasis appears slightly worse compared to the prior study. : ARTERIAL STUDY HISTORY: Cutdown for removal of an intra-aortic balloon pump on the left. FINDINGS: Duplex and color Doppler of the left inguinal area was performed. Waveforms at the left common femoral artery are monophasic which indicate an element of inflow disease, most likely at the iliac level. Grayscale and color Doppler also indicate areas of sequential stenosis involving the superficial femoral artery, velocities do not appear to be elevated, but likely due to poor inflow. All waveforms do remain monophasic diffusely. There is no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm or hematoma or AV fistula. IMPRESSION: . No sequela of recent cutdown for removal of a left femoral access used for an intra-aortic balloon pump. . Findings consistent with both inflow and outflow disease at the femoral level, i.e., superficial femoral arterial stenosis, probable common femoral or external iliac disease on the left. TECHNIQUE: Bilateral lower extremity grayscale and color and pulsed-wave Doppler. COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: A clot is identified in the left greater saphenous vein. A clot is also identified in the right peroneal veins. There is a hematoma around the right proximal superficial femoral vein without evidence of color flow to suggest pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula. There is normal phasicity of the common femoral veins bilaterally. There is normal compression and waveforms in the common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, and posterior tibial veins bilaterally. There is normal compression of the peroneal vein on the left. The right peroneal vein is not compressible and no color flow could be demonstrated. IMPRESSION: . Deep venous thrombosis in the right peroneal veins. . Superficical thrombophlebitis of the left greater saphenous vein. . Hematoma around the proximal superficial vein without evidence of color flow to suggest pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula. TTE : Conclusions Chest Closure ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=- %. The remaining left ventricular segments contract normally and are unchanged from prior. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No evidence of dissection. The aortic valve leaflets ( appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. A mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is present and well seated without perivalvular leak. Dr. was notified in person of the results in the operating room EKG: Atrial fibrillation with ventricular premature beats. Right bundle-branch block. Left anterior fascicular block. Compared to the previous tracing of the Q-T interval looks slightly shorter on the current tracing. The other findings are similar. Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the hospital preoperatively recently diagnosed with atrial fibrillation who presented with chest pain at rest.Past history of CABG. Admitted to hospital with CHF and was diursed. He was taken emergently to the OR and emergently placed on bypass please see intraoperative note for details. He arrived from OR with open chest,paralyzed, sedated on multiple pressors and inotropes, initally low index and mixed venous, IABP :. Of note this had been placed surgically in the OR. IABP removed at bedside within hrs, purse string stitch in place. Left leg cooler with weak pulse in the setting of pressors and thromcytopenia. He was seen by the vascular service but no intervention was warranted and left leg continued to improve. Pressors and inotropes were weaned off slowly he remained in atrial fibrillation. His chest was sucessfully closed on POD. He awoke slowly over the course of three to four days. He was aggressively diureses. He eventually extubated and was very deconditioned, required aggressive pulmonary toileting. He became alkalotic and lasix was adjusted. His renal function remained stable. Chest tubes and pacing wires removed without difficulty. Prior to transferring to floor he developed left lower extremity erythemia and left calf pain. The concern arose for DVT or compartment syndrome. He was again seen by the vascular service. His studies were negative for significant DVT please see reports for further details, negative for comparment syndrome. The celulitis responed to antibiotic therapy. He was started on vanco and was transitioned to cipro for one week. Patient continued to progress but remained weak and deconditioned, his left leg remains weaker then his right. He otherwise remains neurologically intact. He was cleared by speach and swallow to advacne to regular diet. He was started on anticoagulation and his INR goal is he was therapeutic at discharge. This will need to be monitored closely while on cipro he did become supratherapeutic while in the ICU and received vitamin K. His diuretic therapy was initially dc'd due to elevated creatinine but was restarted and increased at discharged due to worsening bilateral effusions. He will need his Bun/creat and CXR repeated and followed while at rehab. His foley was discharged today and is DTV upon arrival to rehab. He was seen by the wound nurse for left lower ext skin breakdown the recs are as follows: Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines Turn and reposition every - hours and prn Heels off bed surface at all times Multipodis Splints to LLE/ Please use lateral rotation bar to prevent external rotation of his LLE If OOB, limit sit time to one hour at a time and sit on a pressure relief cushion. Elevate LE's while sitting. Moisturize B/L LE's, periwound tissue and feet with Aloe Vesta Moisture Barrier Ointment Commercial wound cleanser or normal saline to cleanse all open wounds. Pat the tissue dry with dry gauze. Apply moisture barrier ointment to the periwound tissue with each drg change.

Brief Hospital Course: year old female with ESRD on HD, CAD s/p MI and PCI, DM, RAS presented from OSH with hypoglycemia, hypotension, abdominal pain, UTI, now normotensive with new epigastic pain and persistent intermittent hypoglycemia. --In the MICU, patient treated for UTI and question of urosepsis with Cipro. Pyelonephritis was considered possible source of abdominal pain. Urine cultures came back positive for pansensitive E. coli and patient was continued on Cipro. There was no growth in blood cultures. She was ruled out for MI with mild troponin elevation in the setting of renal failure but flat CKs. Patient was restarted on HD the day following admission. Her labetolol, norvasc, clonidine, and isosorbide were held. She had no further hypotension following initial volume recessitation. However, she continued to be hypoglycemic at times, thought most likely secondary to persistent blood levels of glipizide in the setting of renal insufficiency as well as poor po intake. Patient's po intake began to improve and prior to transfer to the floor, BGs had improved to - . MICU stay also complicated by epigastric abdominal pain and emesis, bilious and non-bloody. Pancreatic enzymes and LFTs were normal. PTT and INR elevated in MICU. Heparin sc stopped. Both trended down on repeat checks. . The morning after transfer, the patient was found to have increasing nausea and vomiting that was poorly responsive to anti-nausea meds. As there was concern for cardiac ischemia, an EKG was done that showed new T-wave inversions in the lateral leads. Pt had significan troponin elevation and cardiology was consulted. Though the patient was likely having mild episode of cardiac ischemia, given the patient's significant comorbidities and resolvation of symptoms as well as no hemodynamic compromise, the patient was treated medically with aspirin, plavix, beta blocker and oxygen. The patient was asymptomatic and had downtrending troponins. For the remainder of the hospital, the patient has stable vital signs and no other complaints of chest pressure. .

Brief Hospital Course: This is a year old male with hx of asthma/COPD, hepatitis C, and poly-substance abuse presenting with worsening shortness of breath secondary to a COPD flare day after finishing a long steroid taper. . Brief ICU course: In the MICU, the patient was somnolent but arousable to voice. He had been speaking in full sentences but sometimes fell asleep while talking. He originally had a headache that started around the time his breathing worsened. It was thought there may have been some element of undiagnosed OSA and the patient responded well to bipap. On the patient was on bipap for most of day with slight improvement in his respiratory symptoms, although he did have wheezing. Steroids, azithromycin, and nebs were administered and an a-line was placed. On , he was on vent mask during the day and did well. He required bipap overnight with increased PSV over the course of the night due to increased CO. He had obvious apneic periods and a higher CO in the morning. On , his pCO improved during the day and his bipap at night was set at /. He was satting well on L NC and had been transitioned to PO steroids before being transferred to the floor. . Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure. This was likely multifactorial secondary to a COPD flare and likely OSA. His CO levels were likely elevated at baseline. He progressively became less somnolent and responded well to bipap at night. . COPD exacerbation. He was treated with steroids, azithromycin, and neb treatments PRN during his admission. He had poor air movement, but was satting -% on room air both at rest and while walking on the day of discharge. His HR was in the s to s while resting at baseline and increased to the s while walking. He was on an insulin sliding scale while on high dose steroids during the admission. He was discharged on a long prednisone taper starting at mg daily and decreasing by mg weekly. . OSA. Previously undiagnosed, but the patient did very well using bipap nightly in the hospital. Pulmonary set the patient up with home bipap using / settings temporarily before a sleep study could be performed as an outpatient. . Hepatitis C. Currently stable and LFTs drawn during the admission were normal. . Psych. His home Abilify, Paxil, Remeron, and clonazepam were continued. He required several additional PRN doses of lorazepam for anxiety during his admission. As a result, his home clonazepam dose was increased from twice daily to three times daily on discharge. . Hx of substance abuse. He was closely monitored clinically for signs of withdrawal and continued the nicotine patch for smoking cessation. . Of note, the patient expressed wishes to transfer his care to and to be followed by pulmonologists. A discharge follow-up appointment was made with an provider at the end of this week. He also has pulmonary follow-up in early prior to his steroid taper ending.

Occluded left internal carotid artery. . Atherosclerotic plaque is present in the left common and external carotid arteries. . Atherosclerotic plaque is present in the right internal carotid artery with findings of at least -% stenosis (likely closer to % stenosis. MRA: . Extensive aneurysmal dilation of the descending thoracic aorta measuring up to . cm. There is extensive thrombus formation within the descending thoracic aorta with areas of focal ulceration within the thrombus. The branch vessels of the aortic arch are normal in appearance. There is no clear evidence of dissection. . Supra- and infrarenal aneurysmal dilation of the abdominal aorta with an intervening segment of more normal caliber aorta. Extensive thrombus formation, some of which appears to be of varying stages of formation, is also present within the abdominal aorta. The celiac, superior mesenteric, and renal artery origins appear normal. There is no clear evidence of dissection. . Small left pleural effusion and associated atelectatic changes in the left lung. CXR: . Large descending thoracic aneurysm. . No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. CXR: . Swan-Ganz catheter, and chest tubes in standard positions without evidence of pneumothorax. . Opacification of the left lung secondary to a layering pleural effusion versus pulmonary hemorrhage. . Low position of the endotracheal tube tip located . cm above the level of the carina. Renal Ultrasound: . Color Doppler suggests diminished renal blood flow bilaterally. Given patient's inability to have CT or MR, if renal blood flow is of clinical concern, a nuclear medicine blood flow study can be performed. . No evidence for obstruction. Trace free fluid about right kidney. Videoswallow Eval: Video oropharyngeal swallow exam was performed in conjunction with speech and swallow therapy. Varying consistencies of barium were administered under constant video fluoroscopic monitoring. Aspiration of thin liquids despite use of chin tuck was seen, likely secondary to impaired vocal cord closure. There is significant vallecular residue. No spontaneous cough was observed. Functional swallowing ability was seen with ground solids and extra thick liquids if patient swallowed with chin to her chest and alternating between bite and sip rate. Following this study, there is also evidence of retained barium still within the esophagus CXR: Fluoroscopic guidance was provided for Dr. for Perm-A- Catheter placement without a radiologist present. Two fluoroscopic scout images demonstrate a dual-chamber right Perm-A-Catheter terminating in the SVC. No final diagnostic images were obtained. CXR: Right subclavian line terminating in the superior vena cava. Left lower lung lobe opacity consistent with atelectasis and effusion. Additional persistence of left mid lung zone opacity most consistent with a loculated component to the left pleural effusion, stable. CARDIOLOGY: TEE: Prebypass Study Examination of the heart was limited because the thoracic aneurysm was compressing on the left atrium and left ventricle. Transgastric views prebypass showed normal LV and RV function. The ascending aorta is normal in size with a well formed sinotubular junction and there is no aortic regurgitation. cm aneurysm seen in the thoracic portion of the descending aorta with spontaneous echo contrast within the lumen. Post Bypass There is a graft seen on the thoracic portion of the descending aorta. LV and RV function are preserved. No atrial septal defect is seen by D or color Doppler. The aortic valve leaflets ( appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (+ mitral regurgitation is seen. TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with mild global hypokinesis more prominent in the basal to mid septum (may be due to conduction defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets ( are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (+ mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. CYTOLOGY: Pleural Fluid: negative for malignancy Brief Hospital Course: This is the brief summary of this prolonged hospital course for this pleasant -year old female who underwent a thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair on complicated by post-op renal failure due to TTP requiring plasmapheresis and hemodialysis, as well as pulmonary and infectious complications. On day of discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet, comfortable, hemodynamically stable, and requiring rehab placement for ongoing dialysis. On Ms. went to the operating room where she underwent a left thoracotomy and thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair with a gelweave graft (please see the operative note of Dr. for full details. On POD she had decreased urine output and ATN was noted, a renal artery scan showed obstruction of flow for which she was taken back to the operating room for an abdominal angiogram via open right CFA (please see the operative note of Dr. for full details. Patent BL renal arterties with % stenosis were found. She was seen in consultation by renal medicine who recommended dialysis, which began on . Her platelet count was low at ,, a HIT screen was negative. She also had some confusion post-operatively , after extubation on post-op day . Hematology was consulted and her findings were consistent with TTP. He platelet counts improved with plasmapheresis and eventually normalized. She required intermittent neosynephrine and nitroglycerine for BP management while on CVVHD, but eventually was hemodynamically stable and restarted on lopressor as part of her discharge regimen. Her renal failure improved and she was able to make marginal urine (approximately cc/day prior to discharge. From a GI standpoint she was unable to tolerate a regular diet initially after extubation. A bedside swallow evaluation on recomended continued tube feeds, but smallounts of pureed and nectar thickened liquids with modifications. She was seen in consultation by ENT and found to have vocal cord paralysis but no immediate intervention was recommended. A Dobhoff tube was placed for tube feeding, and eventually this was removed and a regular diet was resumed. Nutrition consultation was obtained and nutritional supplements such as Carnation instant breakfast were recommended. She had no major pulmonary issues post-operatively, but did develop a left-sided pleural effusion. This was tapped for approximately liter on and she symptomatically did better. She had no documented post-operative pneumonia. From an infectious disease standpoint she had some fevers around weeks post-operative. Full workup revealed only significant yeast in her urine and she was treated appropriately with Fluconazole. She also had empiric vancomycin around the peri-operative period. The patient worked with physical therapy and was able to ambulate well with some assistance prior to discharge. Social work services were obtained early in her hospital course and case management assisted with finding appropriate rehabilitation, as the patient originally is from . The patient was discharged over month post-operatively in stable condition, tolerating a regular diet,bulatory, with good pain control, and normal cardio-pulmonary function. Her major issues upon discharge included ongoing need for hemodialysis, assistance with physical therapy, and assistance with nutritional support. She has planned follow-up with Cardiac Surgery. All questions were answered to her satisfaction upon discharge. Medications on Admission: Verapamil mg po qdaily Flexaril Vitorin (stopped weeks prior Discharge Medications: .

Prior to admission the patient had had intermittent abdominal pain. Last Thursday he developed severe abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting and went to Hospital. He was found to have a CBD stone and associated pancreatitis on CT. He was admitted and medically treated for pancreatitis withF. The day prior to transfer he was found to have blood sugars in the 's and hyperkalemia. He was started on an insulin gtt and transferred to the ICU. He became tachycardic and his UOP decreased although at that time his SBPs remained stable. He was given IVFs. Over the course of the day he became more tachypneic and tachycardic and was placed on a NRB. He also became delirious and agitated and was intubated the morning of transfer. After intbuation his SBPs dropped to the 's and he was given more IVF with some improvement. He has had verly little urine output since intubation. . When he left the OSH he was on an insulin gtt, propofol, but not on pressors. He has a Right subclavian CVL and an arterial line. Prior to transfer he was on PS / on FiO of % with an ABG of .//. . During the his insulin gtt was stopped and he had a FS checked within the high s. He became difficult to ventilate with PIPs in the 's and was changed to AC. He was briefly hypotensive and was placed on levo, however this was stopped before he arrived at the . . On arrival to the his sats were in the mid 's. He was normotensive and tachycardic. .

The second part is his floor course. . MICU COURSE: Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated the morning of admission at the outside hospital due to tachypnea and hypoxia in the setting of receiving many liters ofF while oliguric. He was initially sedated with fentanyl and propofol, switched to propofol and midazolam. He was ventilated on ARDS net protocol given PaO:FiO < . He was initially very difficult to ventilate, requiring % FiO and particular positioning. He was thought to have abdominal compartment syndrome, compressing his lungs, causing an increased PEEP requirement. He had an esophageal balloon placed temporarily to help estimate pleural pressures and keep plateau pressures at a goal of < . The esophageal balloon was taken out after a few days because it passed through the nasal cavity, and pus drainage was noted draining from his sinuses. After the patient was started on CVVH and significantounts of fluid were removed, the patient's ventilation status significantly improved. His FiO and PEEP were weaned down. He was maintained on volume controlled ventilation with minute ventilation calculated to be L/min. By , the patient was weaned down to Pressure Support , which he was able to tolerate for an extended period of time. His only barrier to extubation at this time was mental status; the patient was still not responsive to verbal commands even with sedation decreased. Over the next seevral days, the patient's mental status has improved and he was able to respond to verbal commands with blinking of his eyes and moving his head. He was able to move his upper and lower extremities in response to commands. He had a transient increase in vent requirements up to PS / due to tachycardia and diaphoresis, low grade fevers, associated with radiographic findings of bilateral lung infiltrates at the bases on CXR and CT of the chest without contrast from concerning for VAP. The patient was started on Vanc (at HD, Zosyn and Cipro for VAP on with the plan to complete a total day course (last day . Following initiation of Abx, the vent requirements have decreased to PS /. He continues to have occasional low grade febile episodes, but these may be attributed to necrotic process in his pancereas or HD line infection. The patient was successfully extubated on . At the time of callout from ICU, he is satting +% on RA. WHile his mental status is considerably improved, he is still AAO, at times confused and very weak. Gallstone pancreatitis: The patient presented to the outside hospital with pancreatitis and was found to have a CBD stone. He was medically treated for pancreatitis with bowel rest andF; however, he clinically continued to worsen and hisylase has continued to rise raising concern that the stone was still causing blockage and damage to the pancreas. An ERCP was done at the bedside the night the patient was transferred to the ICU, during which ml of infected appearing bile was drained. The stone was not found, but a cm French biliary stent was placed in the common bile duct to open up a stricture. CT scan from suugested a possible early forming pseudocyst and concern for splenic vein thrombosis. Surgery was consulted and recommended re-imaging with CT a/p to eveluate for pseudocyst if there is a significant Hct drop given a high risk of pancreatic bleed. However, the patient's Hct remained stable. The patient was started on TPN. On , he was started intermittently on trophic tube feeds as well. While the patient had high initial residuals, he eventually met nutrition goals with tube feeds alone and TPN was discontinued. After extubation, tube feeds were discontinued and the patient was advanced to full liquids. Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive during transport from the outside hospital and after arrival to the ICU. His hypotension was likely due to a combination of the biliary sepsis with his sedation, hypocalcemia, and high PEEP. The patient was started on norepinephrine and vasopressin. He did briefly require phenylephrine as well to keep his MAPs > , particularly in the setting of Rapid Atrial Fibrillation with ventricular rates into the s. The patient was started initially on Zosyn for his sepsis, which was changed to Meropenem on . His blood, stool, and urine cultures continued to be negative. Sputum from showed budding yeast with pseudohyphae. Nasal swab from showed + GP rods, + yeast. The patient continued to have low-grade fevers while on CVVH, though CVVH typically lowers body temperatures; he did spike higher temperatures while off CVVH. Vancomycin was started given concern for pustular drainage around his Right femoral dialysis catheter site. The catheter tip was cultured and showed... The femoral line was pulled for hour line holiday and was replaced with a Right IJ dialysis line on . The patient had been completely weaned off pressors on . A CT pan-scan on showed nearly completely necrotic pancreas, cholelithiasis in an atonic gall bladder, and diffuse membranous sinus disease with opacification of mastoid air cells bilaterally. An erythematous rash on the left flank, noted first on , was evaluated by dermatology and thought to be due to anasarca and stasis. A similar rash developed on the RUE and these were followed on serial exams and improved spontaneously. Micafungin had been empirically started for treatment of possible fungemia in the setting of ongoing fevers on broad spectrum antibiotics in addition to new rash but was discontinued because suspicion for fungemia was low. The rash has continued to improve without further intervention during the rest of his ICU course. Acute renal failure: The patient per OSH records had normal renal function at baseline. His Cr increased rapidly to . and his urine output has dropped off. In the setting of pancreatitis with significant third-spacing and hypotension he likely has oliguric ATN. Bladder pressures were measured regularly, with a goal of < , to evaluate his intra-abdominal pressures, which were thought to have possibly been compressing renal artery flow and contributing to his renal failure. Nephrology was consulted, and the patient was started on CVVHD on for oliguric renal failure with rising BUN and Creatinine. CVVH was successful in removing largeounts of volume, dialyzing K+, and repleting Calcium. Due to pustular drainage around his dialysis catheter noted on , the line was pulled, prompting a line holiday hours and initiation of Vancomycin treatment. The dialysis line was re-sited to the Right IJ vein on , placed by IR, and CVVH was re-started. CVVH was done only intermittently due to frequent clotting of the filtration system. He received the last course of CVVH was a period of hours ending on in AM. On , the patient was started on Hemodialysis. The patient's HD line was pulled on as there was localized erythema and suspicion of infection. Tip was send for culture, which is currently pending. The plan is for the patient to receive a new tunneled HD cath on prior to next HD session. Nephrocaps and phos binder were added. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: On the night of transfer to , the patient went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate that steadily increased to the s, then to the s. A small .mg dose of metoprolol significantly dropped his blood pressures, so an amiodarone drip and a diltiazem drip were started. The diltiazem drip was stopped the next morning when the patient had returned to sinus rhythm. Theiodarone drip was left on until when the patient had received a full g loading dose intravenously. He remained in sinus rhythm for the remainder of his ICU stay. Hyperglycemia: The patient does not have known history of diabetes, however was found to have sugars in the s at the OSH, requiring very largeounts of Insulin. This is likely related to a necrotic process in his pancreas, which has resulted in complete impairment of endocrine pancreatic function. He was weaned off the insulin gtt prior to transfer from OSH but was restarted on an insulin drip on arrival to the ICU. Insulin was later added to his TPN, the insulin drip was stopped, and the patient was maintained on sliding scale subcutaneous insulin. As tube feeds replaced TPN, the patient again required Insulin drip. His daily insulin requirements was calculated, and his dose of Lantus was uptitrated based on his insulin requirements. Since the initiation of PO diet, the patient's BG has been successfully controlled with a combination of Lantus units qAM as Insulin SC sliding scale. Anemia: The patient's Hct on presentation was .. No clinical evidence of bleeding was found, though his Hct has slowly dropped to . by . The patient does have a high risk of a pancreatic bleed. At the time of trasfer from ICU, the patient's Hct has remained stable and there is no current evidence of active bleed. Thrombocytopenia: The patient presented with mild thrombocytopenia, likely in the setting of his acute illness. The thrombocytopenia quickly resolved, and he returned to his baseline platelet level. Once on Floor: . Altered mental status: On transfer to floor, the patient continued to have a clouded sensorium thought to be secondary to continued uremia from his acute renal failure. IR-guided temporary line was placed and HD was performed on . Following dialysis, Mr sensorium cleared substantially. Other underlying causes of altered mental status were also addressed including the possibility of underlying infection. He completed his course for ventilator acquired pneumonia on . Catheter tip cxs, blood cxs, urine cxs, BAL cxs negative. All sedating medications were discontinued. Following these measures, at time of discharge, mental status had cleared substantially, with patient being A+O, able to recite days of week backwards. His mental status abnormalities were ultimately thought to be secondary to uremia. . Renal insufficiency: At time of transfer to floor, was oliguric and uremic. HD initiated as above. Following dialysis on , improvement in mental status and urine output. Sevelamer was initiated for improvement in phosphatemia. After several rounds of HD, his mental status cleared. At time of discharge, creatinine was . and BUN was . He was set up for a nephrology followup as an outpatient and his rehab facility was noted to follow creatinines and assess urine output daily to determine if further dialysis was necessary. Given his improvement prior to discharge, his temporary line was removed. . Cholangitis s/p ERCP with stent placement: On floor, LFTs considerable improved with no abdominal pain. Much improved compared to prior history. Abd CT from several days ago shows possible development of pseudocyst, surgery was reconsulted about possibility of bleeding into cyst but they did not feel that this was an active issue. LFTs,ylase/lipase were stable throughout rest of hospitalization on floor. Mr will need his stent removed on and has follow-up with gastroenterology scheduled. . Hyperglycemia: Thought to be secondary to poorly functioning pancreas in the setting of gallstone pancreatitis. Sugars on the floor were between - . Lantus dose was increased to mg qAM with insulin sliding scale coverage. Rehab facility was urged to continue daily fingersticks with monitoring of sugars with adjustment in lantus and sliding scale as necessary. . Right elbow fracture: S/p fall on floor. Repeat AP and lateral films were obtained, and fracture was thought to be subtle and nondisplaced. Ortho consulted and they felt no need for any intervention. They did recommended physical therapy for chronic bursitis likely present in both elbows. . Hypertension: Blood pressures were under good control with regimen of metoprolol T. . Atrial fibrillation with RVR: After being transferred to floor, Mr remained in sinus rhythm. He was continued on metoprolol mg T. . FEN: Video speech and swallow was repeated around time of discharge; speech and swallow suggested a regular diet with nectar-thick liquids for swallowing. .

Altered mental status Numerous contribitors to his AMS, but the overall picture was that of vastly decreased cortical function, consistent with anoxic brain injury. His elevatedmonia, hypernatremia and low ceruloplasmin may have contributed to his AMS. Adventitious head movements Several muscle groups involved in these movements during ?????? therefore cortical in nature. Suggestive of seizure activity and treated with Dilantin prophylaxis. Likely was secondary to anoxic injury with some sparing of motor neurons versus edema and mass effect. Desquamating skin reaction Unclear etiology, and thought related with profound skin hypoperfusion. Unifying diagnosis unclear. Not likely , Dermatology, who thought that it was most likely secondary to previously dramatic anasarca and then microtrauma of being in bed. Treated with fluid replenishment as if burn patient. Respiratory Failure Agonal brainstem breathing, +/- liver breathing. Brainstem also appeared to be affected based on reflexes/exam, thus likely neurologic. Also contributions by expansion acidosis. Goals of Care Patient made CMO on and expired shortly after extubation. Hypotension Clear loss of spinal reflexes and pupils small suggesting sympathetic output likely lower at brainstem or spinal level. Hyperammonemia Unclear etiology. Too late to present with metabolic disorder, although not impossible. No valproic acid recently. Has liver failure and pancreatic calcification of unknown etiology. Family claim little to no alcohol use. Hypothyroidism Likely sick euthyroid. Hypernatremia Corrected quite quickly ?????? concerning. mEq over nine hours maximal rate from labs. Unlikely problem in itself, but may be edema from anoxic brain injury and the two together may become significant. Anasarca Liver failure, low albumin and renal failure, now with large fluid shift and protein losses through skin. Will likely worsen.

147554.0,": : Service: ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Status post cardiac arrest HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an year old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, gastrointestinal bleed with chronic anemia, chronic renal insufficiency who had been complaining at home of lower back pain. On the morning of admission her daughter was helping her to the bathroom when the patient collapsed without breathing, without pulse. Daughter and initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation and Emergency Medical Services were called. Emergency Medical Services arrived and placed an automated external defibrillator which determined a shockable rhythm. She received one shock of joules which converted her to a pulseless electrical activity rhythm. She was given Atropine and a second shock and went into an atrial fibrillation rhythm with a rapid ventricular response. The patient was started on Lidocaine drip and was transferred to the Emergency Room. Total time pulseless was approximately minutes. The patient arrived to the Emergency Room in rapid atrial fibrillation with a blood pressure in the s and was started on intravenous fluids. Initial electrocardiograms showed no significant ST or T wave changes. Her first CK was , her component was ., her potassium was .. At this time it is felt likely that she had suffered a primary arrhythmia leading to her arrest. The patient was not taken to the Catheterization Laboratory but was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for further management. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Atrial fibrillation for which she is on Amiodarone. She has a history of a congestive heart failure with an echocardiogram in showing concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of %. She had biatrial enlargement, moderate mitral regurgitation and severe pulmonary hypertension. She also had a history of chronic anemia. She has a history of a gastrointestinal bleed in which was felt to be due to a gastric arteriovenous malformation. She also has chronic thrombocytopenia with a baseline platelet count of about ,. She also has chronic renal insufficiency. Her baseline creatinine is approximately .. MEDICATIONS AT HOME: . Aspirin mg q.d. . ToprolL mg q.d. . Zestril mg q.d. . Prilosec mg q.d. . Multivitamin one tablet q.d. . Amiodarone mg q. day SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her family, she has a homemaker. She walk with a cane. She does not have a history of tobacco and she occasionally uses alcohol. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission her vital signs were temperature of ., heartrate , blood pressure /, breathing times per minute. She was vented on assist control, cc by with % FIO and positive end-expiratory pressure of . Initial examination was an elderly intubated woman who was sedated. Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination showed her to be normocephalic, atraumatic with bilateral surgical pupils. Neck examination was supple with no jugulovenous distension appreciated. There was no lymphadenopathy noted. Cardiac examination showed a right ventricular heave. It was irregularly irregular with S and S and S murmur. Her chest examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her abdomen was soft and distended but nontender. There were bowel sounds in all four quadrants. She was guaiac positive from below. Her extremities showed trace peripheral edema. There were + pulses bilaterally. Neurological examination: She was intubated and sedated. There was no spontaneous movement noted. LABORATORY DATA: Her laboratory data on admission showed a white count of ., hematocrit of ., platelets of . Chem- showed sodium of , potassium ., chloride of , bicarbonate , BUN and creatinine . with a glucose of . Her INR was ., her PTT was .. Initial CK was with a negative MB and a troponin of .. Urinalysis revealed no red cells, no white cells and no casts. Chest x-ray on admission showed cardiomegaly with a calcified aorta. Electrocardiogram showed an atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and infrequent ectopy. She received a chest and abdominal computerized tomography scan showing no aortic aneurysm. There was no dissection but there was a small right pleural effusion. Head computerized tomography scan showed periventricular white matter changes but no acute bleed. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for further management. CKs were cycled and were negative. The patient did not go for cardiac catheterization as this was felt to be a primary arrhythmogenic event. The patient had her potassium repleted by both p.o. and intravenous replacement with a rapid rise in potassium to . on the first day of admission. The patient had an arterial blood gases with pH of ., pCO of , pO of on the above mentioned settings. The patient was started on Thiamine and Folate. She as switched to Captopril and her Lopressor increased and converted to a normal sinus rhythm by day of her admission. The patient remained breathing over the vent by one to two breaths per minute. The patient underwent bedside electroencephalogram to evaluate for neural activity as well as potential seizure activity. Initial electroencephalogram readings suggested that she was having seizure activity and on hospital day went into a nonconvulsive status epilepticus status. The patient was loaded on Phenobarbital with continuation of the status. I received two additional loads of Phenobarbital with a goal level of greater than which eventually started to break her status epilepticus. She did continue to have episodes of epileptiform activity on her bedside electroencephalogram and so Valproate was added to her regimen at that point. With therapeutic levels of Valproate and Phenobarbital she was felt to have control of her epileptic activity. In addition to the epileptiform activity the bedside electroencephalogram revealed significant anoxic encephalopathy. At this point it was felt that further neurological recovery was unlikely and a family meeting was called to determine what the future goals of care should be. After extensive discussions with the family it was felt that the patient would want to be continued on longterm care as long as life was viable. As a result the plan was made for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and tracheostomy which initially was held up due to elevated INRs which corrected slowly with the addition of Vitamin K. The patient was started on tube feeds which she tolerated well. On , showing no further epileptiform activity and with a corrected INR the patient had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and tracheostomy tube placed. She has remained cardiovascularly stable with blood pressures running to , well controlled on antihypertensives. Her Lidocaine as previously mentioned was discontinued on day . She has had no further significant ectopic activity. . Cardiovascular - A. Arrhythmia, the patient was felt to have a primary arrhythmia due to hypokalemia in the setting of pre-existing structural heart disease. It is not felt that this was an ischemic event and with the corrected potassium she has had no further ectopic activity. It was elected to defer any further electrophysiologic study at this time given the approximate cause of a low potassium. B. Coronary artery disease, patient with a history of coronary artery disease but does not seem to have had an acute coronary spasm. C. Pump status, the patient with a relatively preserved ejection fraction at this time. She has continued to perfuse will throughout her hospital stay here, occasionally requiring a small Lasix dose. She was started on mg p.o. Lasix on . . Pulmonary status - The patient is currently on a ventilator at assist control with title volumes of set at times breaths per minute with an FIO of %. The patient has had no difficulty with her oxygenation, however, after trials of pressure support mode, the patient developed apnea and required to be placed back on assist control mode of ventilation. At this point given her neurologic status we see little prospect of further improvement and was given a tracheostomy. . Renal - The patient with stable renal function throughout her stay here with no elevation in BUN and creatinine. The patient has had some progressive peripheral edema, though no respiratory compromise. The patient is well controlled on small doses of Lasix p.o. . Gastrointestinal - The patient is getting feedings through her percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, is tolerating it well with low residuals. There has been no evidence of gastrointestinal bleed though she was initially guaiac positive from below. She has had brown, well formed stools throughout her stay here. . Infectious disease - The patient with no acute infectious problems. The patient did, during her hospital stay have one out of four bottles positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis. This was thought to be a contaminate. Although the patient has continued to have a mildly elevated white count, she has had no other focal signs of infection and she has not been treated with antibiotics. . Endocrine - The patient has been stable from blood sugar point of view. There is no indication for adrenal compromise as well. DISPOSITION: The patient is to be sent for longterm care. The patient is still a full code according to the family's wishes. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: . Nystatin Swish and Swallow . Zantac mg p.o. q. day .

The lungs are otherwise clear. There are no pleural effusions. . f/u f/u CXR Continued improvement in lung volumes. Brief Hospital Course: . Respiratory Distress: Present in ED secondary to AMS and inability to protect the airway; ultimately attributed to EtOH intoxication. CT head witho contrast was negative for mass effect or hemorrhage. Pt's respiratory acidosis was likely from hypoventilation secondary to altered mental status. Additionally, pH may be slightly lower than would be expected due to lactic acidosis from immobilization for prolonged period of time; CK and renal function tests were not suggestive of rhabdo. There is some question of whether he aspirated while obtunded, and although clincal exam supported this, he remained afebrile without leukocytosis. Abx for PNA were deferred, and pt was maintained on ETT intubation in C-collar on logroll precautions until later in that AM, when he self-extubated witho complication. Pt's C-spine was cleared by CT and clinically, and TLS was cleared clinically. Pt maintained adequate oxygenation s/p extubation on O via NC, and was weaned to RA witho issue. Pt's CXR suggesting mucus-plugging atelectasis improved upon interval examinations, and pt will need close f/u with PCP for continued monitoring of this issue. . . ALOC (EtOH intoxication: EtOH level in blood seemed low for theount of obtundation seen initially on physical exam. However, pt denied daily EtOH intake, and notes that he ""got really drunk"" for a concert last night, suggesting relative EtOH intolerance. CT head witho contrast was negative for mass effect or hemorrhage, and serum osms ruled out ethylene glycol intoxication. Pt received banana bag, thiamine, and folic acid for repletion. Pt also received Ativan prn per CIWA scale witho seizure activity or DTs. Pt denied substance abuse, did not want further counseling for his substance abuse, and wanted to leave ASAP. Pt was warned regarding the dangers of EtOH abuse, especially given his altered MS following a binge. Pt was given contact info for several substance abuse programs in at discharge. . . Hand Wound - pt punctured his L palm with a radio antenna during his intoxicated state. -rays ruled-out retained , pt was fully NV intact with FROM and excellent capillary refill. Per plastics recs, pt will complete a day course of Augmentin qh po for days, and may soak the wound in salt water for min twice daily until wound has healed.

No atrial septal defect is seen by D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >%. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets ( are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (+ mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. . CT chest: IMPRESSION: . Large, symmetric bilateral pleural effusions with attenuation values consistent with simple fluid. . Opacities most suggestive of extensive bibasilar compressive atelectasis although the presence of infection is not excluded by this study. . Geographic ground-glass attenuation in the bilateral upper lobes which is nonspecific, though likely reflects pulmonary edema although hemorrhage could also be considered as the etiology. . Diffuse anasarca within the subcutaneous soft tissues. . Inspissated secretions in distal bronchiol segments in the right lower lobe. . Standard position of all lines and tubes. . Hyperdense liver which can be seen in iron deposition disease oriodarone use. . Small nodular thyroid for which correlation with thyroid function testing and consideration of ultrasound is suggested when clinically appropriate. . RENAL ULTRASOUND IMPRESSION: . No evidence of renal artery stenosis. . No hydronephrosis. . Minimal ascites. Brief Hospital Course: yo female with h/o non-Hodgkin's lymphoma c/b an unclear h/o cutaneous vasculitis and cryoglobulinemia and chronic kidney disease with renal biopsy showing membranous profilerative glomerulonephritis consistent with cryoglobulinemia, transferred from an OSH with respiratory failure and acute on chronic renal failure. . . Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient arrived severely fluid overloaded, but with minimal urine output. Infection seemed unlikely, as she had not had fevers or leukocytosis, though she had been on high-dose steroids. Pulmonary hemorrhage was considered given the h/o vasculitis and hazy bilateral infiltrates. Initial bronchoscopy showed some blood in the bronchi, so the patient received hrs of high-dose steroids. However, repeat bronchoscopy showed a smallount of blood that cleared easily with lavage, making pulmonary hemorrhage less likely. CT scan of the chest was also more consistent with fluid overload. Steroids were stopped. Patient was aggressively diuresed and was able to be extubated. After call out from MICU she continued to have hypoxic episodes on the floor while sleeping with subjective paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Per Xray, these may have been episodes of flash pulmonary edema. She was aggressively diuresed with Lasix to reduce the fluid overload, estimated at over L. Approximately L was removed during her hospital stay, and her respiratory function improved such that she was stable on L NC with no episodes of desaturation within hours. She should continue Lasix at mg IV to continue diuresis of -L daily until she returns to her dry weight (estimated at lbs, at which time she can revert to her prior home dose. . . Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has a known history of MPGN per prior renal biopsy, presumably associated with her hemstologic malignancy, however the Nephrology team did not feel that her fluid overload could be attributed to this disease, but this may have contributed to her response to the aggressive hydration in the weeks prior to her transfer to . Urine sediment analysis revealed muddy brown casts consistent with ATN; this was thought to be due to vascular congestion / fluid overload. Of note, the patient received steroids prior to transfer to , which could have partially treated an non-ATN-related condition to adequately impair our ability to see a clear MPGN picture. . Given concern for h/o cryglobulinemia/vasculitis, a panel of rheumatology labs revealed high inflammatory markers and low complement levels, rhematoid factor ~, consistent with known cryoglobulinemia, but not consistent with a pulmonary/renal syndrome, and given muddy brown casts, Nephrology felt a nephritic/vasculitic picture less likely. , ANCA were negative, anti-GBM negative. Her renal function remained stable, with creatinine peaking at .. Her creatinine dropped to her baseline of . at the time of discharge following auto-diuresis and recovery from ATN. However, given her underlying renal disease, it is important she she continue follow-up with Nephrology. . . Pancytopenia: The patient is followed by Hematology at for previous pancytopenia, and is due for repeat bone marrow biopsy next month. Hematology was consulted and did not feel her overall picture or pancytopenia was consistent with active malignancy. Most likely this was a result of severe illness. She should follow-up with her outpatient provider as scheduled. . . Hypertension: The patient has chronic refractory hypertension. Initially antihypertensives were held because of concern for poor renal perfusion. These were restarted, holding losartan and spironolactone given her reduced renal function. Hydralazine and a nitrate were stared, and clonidine was increased to control her SBP < . A renal ultrasound was performed and showed no sign of renal artery stenosis. The Cardiology and Renal teams felt that her hypertension could be explained by fluid overload, and recommended reassessment once her fluid balance was corrected. Echo showed new mitral regurgitation, but intact ventricular function. At the time of discharge, she was on her home doses oflodipine and carvedilol, increased doses of Lasix and clonidine, and had started hydralazine and nitrate. As her fluid overload is corrected, it is anticipated that she will return to her home regimen by restarting spironolactone and losartan, tapering off hydralazine and isosorbide mononitrate, reducing clonidine to her home dose, and reducing Lasix to her home dose. . . s/p cholecystectomy: On arrival to , she was on Zosyn for post-surgical prophylaxis. There was no report of fever or suspected cholangitis from the OSH, so this was stopped one day after presentation. Her incisions remained clean and intact, and she had no fever or sign of infection. . Transitional issues .

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane. Discharge Instructions: Dear Mrs. , It was a pleasure taking care of you at . You were admitted to the hospital due to respiratory failure and renal failure after having your gallbladder removed. During your ICU stay you were found to have excess fluid throughout your body. You were given medication (Lasix to remove this fluid throughout your stay. As the fluid was removed, you were deemed stable enough to transfer to the floor. Your kidney function improved to your baseline. Your respiratory status improved and you required less oxygen. You had several episodes of respiratory distress at night when it was difficult to breathe. These were due to the excess fluid and did not continue as the fluid was removed. At the time of your discharge, we had removed approximately L of fluid. However, you will need further fluid loss to get back to your normal weight. The Lasix should be continued and you should track your weight daily to ensure that you continue to make progress. You should follow-up with your nephrologist (kidney specialist as planned to track your kidney function. Throughout your stay, your blood pressure was high relative your to normal level. This is most likely because of the excess fluid. We have made several adjustments to your home medications to control your blood pressure and to avoid damaging your kidneys. As the fluid is removed, you can plan to return to your home regimen. The most likely order of changes: - restart spironolactone and losartan once your kidney function is normal - reduce the doses of hydralazine and isosorbide mononitrate, with the goal of stopping them - reduce clonidine to your previous dose - reduce Lasix to your previous dose (once all the fluid is gone This is a possible approach. Your physicians at Rehab and/or your primary care physician will determine the order and appropriate doses of medication. During one of your imaging studies (CT scan it was noted that you had a small nodule on your thyroid. We recommend that you discuss this with your primary care provider. may want to have blood work to check your thyroid function, or an ultrasound of the thyroid. You also were noted to have low blood counts of your white and red cells. You should be sure to keep your appointment with your hematologist as planned next week. MEDICATION CHANGES: - STOP spironolactone due to your reduced kidney function - STOP losartan due to your reduced kidney function - INCREASE clonidine to .mg twice a day - INCREASE furosemide to mg twice a day. This will be changed to oral and then the dose reduced as the fluid is removed. - START hydralazine mg three times a day for high blood pressure - START isosorbide mononitrate mg daily for high blood pressure - START Tylenol, oxycodone, and lidocaine patch for pain. The doses will be adjusted at Rehab. - START Maalox, Colace, Senna, and simethicone for dyspepsia and constipation. The doses will be adjsuted at Rehab. - START Flonase, guaifenesin, Cepacol lozenges and nasal saline spray for nasal congestion. The doses will be adjusted at Rehab. - START Ambien for sleep while in Rehab. Followup Instructions: You already have appointments with an Oncologist and a Nephrologist. Please keep these appointments as planned. When you leave the rehab facility, please plan to follow-up with your primary care physician.",Discharge summary,"5845,51881,42833,4280,4254,28419,20280,2732,78630,5853,40390,28521"
171533.0,": : : Sex: M Service: Medicine, Firm CHIEF COMPLAINT: Fever and hyperglycemia. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a -year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft, type diabetes, hypertension, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who presented with fever, weakness, and hyperglycemia. The patient was at from visiting his daughter who is currently an inpatient when he developed increased fatigue and weakness. On checking his blood sugars, they were in the s, at which time he presented to the Emergency Department with a fever of . He denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, or bright red blood per rectum. He was initially hemodynamically stable in the Emergency Department, but his blood pressure subsequently fell to the s and s. He was volume resuscitated with liters of normal saline without affect. A right internal jugular triple lumen catheter was placed in the Emergency Department, and Levophed and Neo-Synephrine were initiated for blood pressure support. The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: . Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction in treated at that time with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, followed by a -vessel coronary artery bypass graft in . . Diabetes; on insulin. . Hypertension. . Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; treated with Coumadin. . Congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of %. . Beta-thalassemia trait. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aspirin, Coumadin, lisinopril, Pravachol, Pletal, Lasix, Zaroxolyn, / insulin, Neurontin, and allopurinol. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married. He denies the use of tobacco. He drinks alcohol only occasionally. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION: Examination on admission revealed temperature was , heart rate was , blood pressure was /, respiratory rate was , and oxygen saturation was % on room air. In general, he was lethargic. Oriented times three. He appeared acutely ill. Pertinent physical findings revealed that his oropharynx was dry. His neck was supple with jugular venous pulsation approximately cm. His lungs sounded clear to auscultation bilaterally (by report. His heart examination was regular with normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds. A / systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border. His abdominal examination was unremarkable. His extremities revealed trace pedal edema with chronic venous stasis dermatitis bilaterally and erythema of the left lower extremity around the medial malleolus which was also warmer than surrounding skin. Neurologic examination revealed that he was alert and oriented times three. Cranial nerves throughII were intact. Otherwise, neurologic examination was nonfocal. PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION: Laboratories on admission revealed white blood cell count was . (with a differential of polys, bands, lymphocytes, and monocytes, hematocrit was ., and platelets were . Chemistry- was remarkable for a blood urea nitrogen of and creatinine of .. Blood sugar was on admission. Liver function tests were checked and were within normal limits. Initial set of cardiac enzymes done in the Emergency Department revealed creatine kinase was , with a MB fraction of , and a troponin of .. Coagulations revealed prothrombin time was . and an INR of .. Urinalysis on admission revealed a specific gravity of ., with a small amount of blood, and a glucose measurement of . PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING: Electrocardiogram on admission revealed a sinus rhythm with a right bundle-branch block at a rate of , with ST depressions in V through V. A chest-ray on admission showed cardiomegaly without infiltrate or signs of congestive heart failure. HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM: . INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES: Presumably septic, the patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he was initially treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin after having been started on oxacillin in the Emergency Department for presumed cellulitis of the left lower extremity. His hemodynamic instability improved rather quickly, and his antibiotics were changed to Unasyn; although a source of his sepsis was still unknown. With the patient afebrile without any signs of hemodynamic instability or obvious source of infection, the Unasyn was discontinued; allowing any present infection to present itself. After the discontinuation of the antibiotics, the patient remained afebrile with no signs of obvious infection, and antibiotics were not re-initiated. Blood cultures throughout this admission were negative to date at the time of this dictation. . HYPOTENSION ISSUES: Hypotension again presumed to be sepsis. The patient was treated initially with Levophed and Neo-Synephrine. Further volume resuscitation was held given his high likelihood of the complication of congestive heart failure. Pressors were weaned over the subsequent hours, and by the second hospital day the patient was off all pressors and was maintaining his blood pressure. . CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: In the setting of the patient's hypotension, he developed electrocardiogram changes and had cardiac enzymes measured with a peak troponin of . and a creatine kinase of . Ultimately, the electrocardiogram did not develop T waves, and the patient was diagnosed and treated medically for a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. He was not treated with heparin because he was fully anticoagulated with Coumadin; however, he was continued on aspirin. Once his blood pressure tolerated, his ACE inhibitor was restarted. He was also begun on Lopressor when his blood pressure allowed. With the aggressive volume resuscitation upon admission, the patient did experience congestive heart failure which was treated with his outpatient doses of Lasix and Zaroxolyn once his blood pressure was able to tolerate this. A full set of lipids was checked which revealed a total cholesterol of , high-density lipoprotein was , low-density lipoprotein was , and triglycerides were . Therefore, his Pravachol dosing was not changed. For his atrial fibrillation, his Coumadin was continued at his outpatient dose at mg daily with his INR maintained appropriately. With diuresis, the patient's heart failure improved to his baseline . RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES: Upon admission, the patient's creatinine was .. This was felt to be due to prerenal azotemia. With hydration upon the initial resuscitation, his creatinine improved to .. Subsequently, with the complication of his congestive heart failure, his creatinine worsened again to .. However, with diuresis his creatinine got as low as .; which was likely his baseline. . LEFT KNEE PAIN ISSUES: On hospital day three, the patient developed the acute onset of left knee pain with focal tenderness on the lateral side of the knee with an apparent effusion within the knee. Concern was raised for a septic joint given the likelihood of his recent bacteremia. However, on further probing of the patient's past medical history it was found that he has a history of gout in that knee and had been on allopurinol prior to admission. The patient was treated empirically for gout with colchicine, and Rheumatology was consulted regarding the possibility of an arthrocentesis in the setting of an elevated INR to rule out a septic joint. Rheumatology did tap the left knee and aspirated . cc of joint fluid which was sent for culture; on which there was no growth at the time of this dictation. Following hours of treatment with colchicine, the patient's symptoms improved dramatically, and his walking improved. The patient was to be treated with colchicine . mg p.o. three times per day for a total of three days followed by . mg p.o. once per day for approximately four weeks; at which time he was to follow up with his orthopaedist in and likely restart his allopurinol at that time. . ENDOCRINE SYSTEM: The patient was continued on / insulin with the addition of a regular insulin sliding-scale. Initially, due to decreased oral intake as well as a strict diabetic diet, he was requiring less insulin than he did at home. However, ultimately because of continuing elevated fingersticks his insulin was returned to his outpatient doses. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: . Sepsis of unknown etiology. .

148082.0,": : : Sex: M Service: NOTE: The of is pending. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly, this year old male with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, was admitted originally to the Podiatry Service for a left patellar mid-foot ulcer. He underwent angiogram on , to evaluate his circulation and found at that time that the patient had a poor circulation to the left leg. The patient was transferred to the Vascular Surgery Service for bilateral iliac stenting at that time. The patient also at that time was followed by Cardiology and for preoperative evaluation had a stress test which was positive and he became diaphoretic but denied any chest pain. Atropine was given and heart rate returned to the s and his blood pressure returned to the s over s. The patient denied any orthopnea, shortness of breath, chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or cough. He had occasional leg swelling. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: . Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in and and status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty times two. . Diabetes mellitus type since age ; now currently on insulin, which is complicated by peripheral neuropathy, nephropathy and Charcot's foot. . Chronic renal insufficiency. . Peripheral vascular disease status post left iliac stent and right femoral stent. . Hypertension. . High cholesterol. . Question of tendonitis. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: . Insulin /, units q. a.m. and units q. p.m. . Diovan mg p.o. q. day. . Nortriptyline mg p.o. q. h.s. . Norvasc mg p.o. q. day. . Metoprolol mg p.o. twice a day. . Hydrochlorothiazide, mg p.o. q. day. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient was afebrile; his vital signs were stable. His neck was supple; he had no jugular venous distention. His carotids were two plus bilaterally without bruits. His lungs were clear. His heart was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops. His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended. Bowel sounds are present. He had bilateral femoral bruits and he had one plus popliteal pulses. His pedal pulses are absent. LABORATORY: On admission, his BUN was , creatinine ., hematocrit and the cholesterol was . HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is admitted to this hospital through the Podiatry Service; however, the stress test showed multi-vessel disease. Podiatry continued to follow for evaluation of his left foot ulcer. At the time of discharge, he was having acetic acid wet-to-dry dressing changes, .% q. day. Vascular Surgery was following at the same time and decided that bilateral iliac stenting would be the most optimum treatment currently and suggested that the patient should be worked up for cardiac disease prior to re-vascularization. Medicine was also consulted at that time for high blood pressure and for the biceps pain. While having angiography, he had a transient increase in his blood pressure and became diaphoretic and thus precipitated the evaluation for cardiac disease. Cardiology was consulted at that time to evaluate his heart. The patient was managed on the Medical Service for his drop in blood pressure and cardiac evaluation. He was also followed by Podiatry and Vascular Surgery. He was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory which showed multi-vessel disease and Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted. The patient was taken to the Operating Room on , where a coronary artery bypass graft times four was performed, left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to diagonal, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to PC by Dr. . The patient was transferred to the CSRU postoperatively where he did well. He was slowly weaned from his ventilator and was able to be extubated. The patient was able to be weaned to six liters nasal cannula after extubation, however, it was noted on chest-ray that he had a small apical pneumothorax. A repeat chest-ray showed resolution of that pneumothorax. The patient was continued on an insulin drip for his diabetes mellitus but continued to improve. His chest tube was in place for a high chest tube output. His Foley catheter was removed and the patient was transferred to the Floor. Physical Therapy was consulted in order to assess the patient'sbulation and mobility, however, with his foot infection and associated pain, it was difficult to assess at that time. After arriving on the Floor, the patient had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation which was treated withiodarone and Lopressor. The patient resolved, however, Lasix was also given due to some pulmonary edema and increasing oxygen need. The patient continued to have episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation while on the Floor, which required continued diuresis as well as intravenous Lopressor. His chest tube and Foley catheter were removed on postoperative day number three, and the patient had aggressive chest Physical Therapy and nebulizer treatments. His dressing changes for his foot continued per the Podiatry Service and his leg ulcer was noted to be slowly healing. The patient had multiple episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation which again required intravenous Lopressor. Amiodarone boluses were given and the patient was started on three times a day of p.o.iodarone, aggressive pulmonary toilet and continued diuresis was done, however, the patient continued to have respiratory difficulties when in rapid atrial fibrillation. The patient was evaluated on postoperative day number five and it was decided at that time that the patient should be transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory difficulties. He was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where he was aggressively diuresed as well as his rate was controlled and chest Physical Therapy and nebulizer treatments were done. The patient improved slowly. Also, his white blood cell count was found to rise to .; this was most likely due to a secondary infection of his foot and Zosyn was started. The patient continued to do well and his recurrent atrial fibrillation slowly improved; p.o. doses of Lopressor slowly increased to get better control of his rate and the patient was able to be controlled with a heart rate in the s to s with Lopressor. Following initiation of his Zosyn, the white count continued to improve and the patient was planned for a PICC line for long-term intravenous antibiotics. The patient was started on Lopressor mg p.o. twice a day with good control with a heart rate of s to s. He is in sinus rhythm. He was also started on his preoperative medications of Amlodipine and Losartan with improvement of his blood pressure. The patient was also reduced to mg q. day ofiodarone. Pulmonary was consulted at this time for this difficulty of diuresis and pulmonary edema. They continued to agree with the management of the patient and with aggressive pulmonary toilet as well as diuresis and nebulizer treatment. The patient was transferred back from the Intensive Care Unit on , and upon arriving on the floor, he continued to do well. Pulmonary toilet and aggressive chest Physical Therapy was continued and the patient was able to be weaned from his oxygen. Furthermore, his Foley catheter was removed and he was started on anti-coagulation for his episodes of atrial fibrillation. He had been started on heparin in the Intensive Care Unit and that was continued. Coumadin was then begun with a goal INR of . to .. At that time he was stabilized from a cardiac perspective. Podiatry and Vascular Surgery were reconsulted to assess the patient's needs for revascularization and for his foot ulcer. It was decided at that time that the patient could be discharged in follow-up with Vascular Surgery for revascularization and Podiatry thereafter. On , the patient had a PICC line placed for a six week course of intravenous Zosyn for his foot ulcer and his Coumadin was also continued. The patient did well and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility at that time. His discharge date is pending. CURRENT DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: . Regular insulin sliding scale. .

190921.0,": : : Sex: M Service: MED Allergies: Glucocorticoids : Chief Complaint: altered mental status airway edema Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Emergent tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation S/P removal of tracheostomy Hemodialysis Lumbar Puncture History of Present Illness: Mr. is a year old man with a history of end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, hypertension, cocaine abuse, who presents with fever, chills, after a fall. The history is unclear, mostly obtained from sister, who is not very sure. The patient had been feeling ""not himself"" for a few days. He had a fall days prior to admission (unclear if had been feeling not well even prior to fall and that contributed to the fall, was seen at the , sent home, went to VA emergency department but left because of a long wait. On the morning of admission, he went to the Veterans Administration Hospital for hemodialysis, and was observed to be shaking, then subsequently fell out of a chair, and was sent to this facility for further evaluation and management of the possible seizure. In the emergency department, he was noted to be agitated and received mg Haldol and mg Ativan, after which he became unresponsive and required intubation. Several attempts were made for intubation to protect his airway, but these failed secondary to edema of the oropharynx and tongue. An emergent tracheostomy was performed by the surgery service. Significant labs and studies in the emergency department included a BUN of , Cr of . (He was due for dialysis on day of admit and had missed at least HD appointments shortly before admission. WBC was .. His head CT showed a subdural hematoma, and an a chest ray revealed a developing aspiration pneumonia. Mr. was admitted to the Neurosurgical service for possible evacuation of the subdural hematoma; however, because of its small size and ?diffuse nature, the neurosurgery team determined that it was not suitable for evacuation and the patient was transferred to the MICU. In the MICU, the patient was continued on empiric triple antibiotic coverage for meningitis and even though CSF cultures were negative because the lumbar puncture was performed after administration of antibiotics and showed increased opening pressure and white cell count. According to his sister, the patient's baseline functional status is fully active and independent in all ADLs and other aspects of life. He continued to be somnolent throughout most of his MICU stay, but opened his eyes to voice and was able to move all extremities and follow commands. It was noted that the patient's mental status seemed to improve a bit after dialysis, suggesting that there may also be a toxic-metabolic process involved in his altered mental status. He was also noted to have episodes of increased agitation at night, which were initially managed with haldol. Neurology suggested that the haldol may be contributing to his continued altered mental status, so this was changed to geodon IM as needed, to be used minimally. On transfer to the medicine floor, the patient was afebrile without leukocytosis, hemodynamically stable, and without respiratory distress breathing comfortably on tracheal face mask. Past Medical History: hepatitis C Subdural hematoma (small left parafalcine and tentorial, ESRD on Hemodialysis substance abuse (cocaine prostate cancer diabetes Social History: Lives independently.

Vertebral body height is maintained. There are no cervical fractures identified. In the sagittal plane, the prevertebral soft tissues appear full. Axial images demonstate a vascular structure extending toward the midline. This could be confirmed with a contrast-enhanced CT scan. Additionally, there is an enlarged thyroid gland, which is only partially in view on this study. IMPRESSION: No evidence of cervical fracture or malalignment. Brief Hospital Course: yo M with history of cocaine abuse and ESRD, status post fall and suspected seizure with new subdural hematoma, altered mental status, and temporary dependance on tracheostomy for ventilation. . Altered mental status: Etiology remains unclear, but is likely multifactorial. Initially, subdural hematoma was assumed to be cause of altered mental status; however, it is small in size and has remained stable in serial imaging by CT and MRI scanning. Other possible contributing factors include drug or metabolic toxicity in the setting of ESRD, infection (meningitis or encephalitis, and prolonged post-ictal state. No evidence of cerebrovascular accident was noted on imaging. Toxic-metabolic work-up did not reveal any abnormalities, aside from the elevated BUN on admission. Liver (includingmonia leveland thyroid function tests were normal. RPR was negative. Lead level was pending at time of discharge. EEG was suggestive of encephalopathy but no seizure activity was noted. Echocardiogram revealed no valvular vegetations as a possible source of septic emboli. He was started on thiamine, folate, and vitamin B and loaded with phenytoin for the questionable seizure. His mental status waxed and waned and we discontinued the dilantin thinking that it was causing his lethargy. Per neurology, his seizure history is somewhat vague, so they were agreeable to monitoring him in the hospital off dilantin. He did not have any witnessed seizures in the hospital. He completed a two week course of empiricpicillin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir for possible meningitis. A lumbar puncture was obtained days after antibiotics were begun because of initial concern that he may herniate. CSF analysis was significant for an elevated WBC count of with % neutrophils and % lymphocytes. Opening pressure was also elevated at mm Hg, which although may have been partially positional, exceeds the expected increase, and raised concerns for an infectious etiology. CSF cultures were negative. PCR for HSV was unable to be accomplished due to lack of adequate sample size. patient was not cooperative with further EEG or lumbar puncture. Of note, throughout his hospital course, mental status seemed to improve after dialysis at which time the patient was often oriented to being in the hospital in addition to himself and was able to speak in full sentences, suggesting that there may also be a toxic-metabolic process involved. According to his sister, his baseline functional status is fully active and independent. He was somnolent but able to open eyes to command, until approximately when he became more aware. He was also noted to have episodes of increased agitation at night, thought to be sundowning. These were initially managed with haldol and geodon. Standing risperdal was started and increased to mg in AM and mg QPM. The risperidone seemed to have the best effect. He was seen by the neurology service during his hospital stay and his mental status was normal at time of discharge with only some mild condusion in the morning. . Respiratory failure: The patient required emergent tracheostomy in the ED since he was unable to protect his airway due to altered mental status and possiby sedation. Intubation was unsuccessful due to airway edema. He was weaned quickly to trach mask with good oxygenation, but because of the continued edema, decannulation could not be attempted while in the MICU. The tracheostomy was altered for Passy-Muir valve and the patient was transferred to the medicine floor while breathing comfortably with good oxygenation on the % face mask. His course was complicated by copious oral and tracheal secretions that required frequent suctioning. Nebulizer therapy with albuterol was given. After a week, the airway edema appeared to be resolved externally and he tolerated a day breathing room with the trach capped. Subsequently, the tracheostomy apparatus was removed without complication by Dr. surgery service and the patient had -% saturation on room air. He was on a prednisone taper at time of discharge of mg daily to be weaned over the next few days post-discharge. The wound remained clean, dry, and intact dressed with gauze. . Airway Edema: It is uncertain whether airway edema encountered in the ED was traumatic (multiple attempted were made at intubation or caused by angioedema related causes such as idiopathic, hereditary, or medication related. The patient was not given or had no indications of taking medications implicated in the induction of angioedema. According to his sister, he may have had a history of past airway edema associated with medication (she is uncertain which one, but no one else in the family has this problem. report, he was not on an ACE-inhibitor. Complement studies were sent to evaluate for hereditary angioedema; to date, analysis of the complement pathway appears to be normal. Results of functional testing of C inhibitor are pending. CT or the neck showed evidence of swelling limited to the airway above the tracheostomy, as well as a diffuse goiter that had been noted in past studies (thyroid function testing was normal. He was started on prednisone mg for three days and proceeded to undergo a slow tapering. Successful swallowing study for soft solids and excellent oxygen saturation on room air provided clinical indication that the airway edema improved. Otolaryngology service consulted for airway evaluation but the patient was not cooperative with rhinolaryngoscopy. The /immunology service assisted with the analysis of allergic or hereditary causes for the airway edema; however, no obvious cause was found. The patient is recommended to follow up in the allergy clinic for further evaluation as an outpatient and to avoid ACE inhibitors. . End Stage Renal Disease: The patient was dialyzed x/week (M/W/F. He received nephrocaps, calcium acetate, zemplar, ferrlecit, and epogen. Renagel was discontinued and the calcium acetate was discontinued after several days. Per nursing report, the patient did produce urine while on the medicine floor. . Hypertension: In the MICU, the patient's blood pressure was initially quite labile and especially affected by agitation. It was controlled with hydralazine mg PO(NG Qhr and metoprolol mg PO(NGT for the majority of his hospital course. Later, hydralazine was weaned and discontinued in preference for calcium channel blockade. His regimen at discharge was metoprolol mg and Nifedipine CR mg daily. . Anemia: Iron studies point to chronic disease and renal failure as etiologies. He was started on epogen and ferrlecit, which he received at each dialysis. His hematocrit remained stable and he required no transfusions. Stool guaciac analyses were negative. There was a low hematocrit of . on and repeat draw was . He may need transfusion at his next hemodialysis. . Nutrition: He was started on tube feeds appropriate for ESRD, per nutrition recommendations, in the MICU. Since he pulled out his NG tube after transfer to the medicine floor, a swallowing evaluation showed that he was able to swallow soft solids and thin liquids without difficulty. However, sometimes the patient refused oral intake, including medication, when agitated. Aspiration precautions were maintained. Renal appropriate vitamin and mineral supplementation was provided. At time of discharge he was eating well with aspiration precautions. . Hyperparathyroidism: His highly elevated PTH level was likely due to ESRD because a subset of ESRD patients will have refractory hyperparathyroidism with levels over times normal and may need parathyroidectomy if symptomatic. The PTH level in this patient was most consistent with renal disease-induce secondary hyperparathyroidism and he was treated with zemplar at dialysis. . Goiter: Neck CT with contrast confirmed a previously identified thyroid mass. However, the thyroid was not well visualized secondary to interval tracheostomy. The diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland was consistent with goiter. An outpatient thyroid ultrasound was recommended when the patient is clinically stable for further evaluation. Note that thyroid function laboratory testing was normal. . History of Fevers: During his hospital course, the patient was largely afebrile without leukocytosis on empiric coverage for meningitis. In studies performed while the patient was in the MICU, there was no sign of upper extremity DVT on ultrasound, no cardiac thrombus, no chronic sinusitis, no malignancy seen in spinal fluid, and no new infiltrates on CXR. After NG tube placement for days, the patient was noted to have sinus air/fluid levels on imaging as expected since % of patients with extended NG placement have this finding. He was already covered for many common organisms with his week antibiotic regimen and he had no signs or symptoms of sinusitis. Urine, blood, and sputum cultures were negative. Stool was negative for c. difficile. Foley catheterization was discontinued . On the general medicine service, the patient remained afebrile without elevated white cell count. . Right shoulder pain: He presented s/p fall and his right shoulder was thought to be injured during that fall. Plain films revealed no fracture. He was unable to comply with MRI on . He will need sedation with an MRI in the near future to evaluate for possible rotator cuff tear. . Hitory of Hepatitis C. His viral load was ,, during hospitalization. His will need follow up as an outpatient regarding possible treatment. . History of Prostate cancer: We were not successful at obtaining outside records from or . His PSA here was , baseline unknown.

168004.0,": : : Sex: F Service: MED Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs : Chief Complaint: Esophageal Variceal Bleeding and Shock Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation and Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt Placement History of Present Illness: F with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension, splenomegaly, ascites, and grade esophageal varices, DM-II, reactive airways disease, and possibly hemochromatosis who is being transferred from an OSH for management of her bleeding esophageal varices and possible TIPS placement. The pt was initially admitted to Hospital on for symptomatic hematemesis. She was transfused pRBC and on the day of admission she underwent EGD-guided variceal banding and sclerotherapy. She was intubated for airway protection, monitored in the ICU, and treated with an octreotide drip, empiric antibiotics (ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis against SBP, and vitamin k. She was extubated , and was called out to the floor given her clinical and hemodynamic stability. On , EGD was repeated, grade esophageal varices were again seen, and banding was again performed at that time. Although she was not reintubated at that time, she was again intubated on for airway protection in the setting of altered mental status that had been present for roughly five days; she has been intubated since that time. Because of her altered mental status, and given her moderate ascites, a paracentesis was performed on to r/o spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. This study was not diagnostic of SBP (there were roughly PMNs per mL in the ascitic fluid, and the culture of the ascitic fluid was negative, but the patient was empirically treated for SBP nonetheless. She was also treated with lactulose beginning on , as her serummonia level was drastically elevated (. There was also a question of a LLL pneumonia on CXR (which likely would have been treated by the ceftriaxone that was started for empiric treatment of her SBP vs. ICU psychosis. On she had a second episode of variceal bleeding; EGD was again performed, and bleeding grade esophageal varices were again sclerosed. She was again treated with an octreotide drip and was again transfused pRBC; she was transfused a total of units of pRBC throughout her hospitalization at the OSH. On she had a third episode of UGIB and plans were then made for transfer to the for evaluation of possible TIPS placement. The remainder of her hospital course was noteworthy for the following: ( A seizure on . She was subsequently loaded on phenytoin and treated with fosphenytoin after a head CT was found to be negative. ( Progressive abdominal distension beginning on roughly . KUBs have demonstrated dilated loops of bowel consistent with ileus vs. partial obstructon.

Shock: Upon admission to the MICU, the patient was in shock with lactic acidosis. Her variceal bleeding as evidenced by EGD evaluation (showing clotted esophageal and not gastic varicies did not explain her initial requirement for blood pressure support. Upon admission, she was mainted with PRBC,F, and triple pressor therapy (Norepinephrine, Vasopressin, and Dopamine. Given her history of ETOH Cirrhosis and protuberant abdomen, a paracentesis was performed - an infection was not discovered. Further, blood and urine cultures along with an abdominal CT (to search for an occult abscess, perforated viscus or infectious process were also unrevealing. Although the initial chest radiograph did not show a pneumonia, subsequent films showed an infiltrate in the RLL. Antibiotic therapy (see below were commenced. An ACTH stimulation test was abnormal and thus, fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone were commenced for an idiopathic cortisol deficiency. Of note, and echocardiogram was also unremarkable, as there was no sign of a pericardial effusion or depressed LVEF to explain her hypotension. Over the next several days, her pressor therapy was weaned, her steroids were tapered, and her hematocrit stabilized. UGIB/Anemia: As mentioned, esophageal varices were noted on EGD (initially discovered at the OSH. She had failed sclerotherapy and banding at the OSH as well. She was seen by hepatology and interventional radiology at and a TIPS procedure was pursued, after an EGD evaluation (as above. She had no subsequent bleeding and her HCT was stable thereafter. She was prophylaxed with antibiotics (Zosyn given her acute variceal bleed. During her course on the regular medical floor, she subsequently developed large melana. Her TIPS remained patent. She was restarted on a short of octreotide retransfused with PRBC, PLTS, FFP and Cryoprecipitate. The patient and family chose to forgo endoscopy. Nevertheless, the bleeding resolved spontaneously and recurrence of bleeding did not occur. The GI team felt the bleed was likely secondary to erosions around previous banding sites. Airway Protection: The patient was intubated upon admission secondary to impending respiratory failure in the face of shock and hepatic encephalopathy. By the time her shock had resolved the patient was quickly weaned from mechanical ventilation and extubated. She tolerated extubation well. However, hypophonia was soon discovered. It persisted throughout her course. This was believed secondary to ETT trauma during intubation as ENT evaluation revealed laryngeal edema. AMS: Her altered mental status was presumed secondary to her hepatic encephalopathy along with a possible contribution from a current pneumonia. Furthermore, many days of sedating drugs also likely contributed to her slow recovery from obtundation to a sleepy and semi-alert state. Once GI access was obtained, she was commened on oral lactulose and metronidazole therapy. Of note, seizure activity was reported from the outside hospital. A definite etiology or evidence for the seizure was not found. She was continued on Dilantin mg B, which was later discontinued after seizures were deemed unlikely. Diagnostic possibilities were alcoholic withdrawal and brain metastasis (see below. Over her course, her mental status improved markedly, with waxing and episodes of delirium. The frequency of these episodes also markedly decreased over her course. ETOH Cirrhosis: Although, no known biopsy reports were made available to the team, a nodular liver was evident on ultrasonography. Of note, a possible history of hemochromatosis was recorded in her medical history. She was continued on Lactulose PO T and Metronidazole for hepatic encephalopathy paliation. A TIPS was placed and she was also started on Nadolol (once her blood pressure was stable to allieviate her portal hypertension. Although her AFP was ., RUQ U/S revealed a nodular lesion of the liver concerning for HCC or possibly metastatic disease. PNA: A right lower lobe pneumonia with an accompanying effusion was seen on CT initially. She was started on empiric coverage for a vent-acquired and aspiration pneumonia and started on Vancomycin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam for which she completed a d course. Her sputum cultures were unrevealing. Coagulopathy: Given her liver disease and concern for septic shock initially, the patient had elevated coagulation studies (INR/PTT and low platelets. She was given a Vitamin K, platelet transfusion and FFP upon admission - these were also given prior to TIPS. Over her course, her bleeding ceased and her coags trended downwards and stablized. Of note, she had one episode of epistaxis in the middle of her MICU stay. An ulcer was seen in the anterior nasal septum. She was given FFP and a platelet transfusion and her nose was packed by ENT. Her bleeding did recur once, as mentioned above. Of note, initial DIC labs were unrevealing (Fibrinogen and FDP. Alcoholism: She was kept on the CIWA scale and initially mainted on Propofol (effective for GABA agonism. She was maintained on Diazepam PRN for withdrawal symptoms, but this was not required during her hospital course. ARF: Although her creatinine was . on presentation, it trended down to within normal limits over her course, as her shock resolved. The etiology was liklely an acute exacerbation (via hypoperfusion of a chronic hepatorenal syndrome. Lung CA: At the OSH, bleeding from the endotracheal tube was noted. A bronchoscopy was pursued and via brush biopsy, atypical cells concerning for NSCLC (Squamous Cell were seen in the LLL. A CT of her chest showed a LLL nodule. The pulmonologist at Hospital who performed the bronchoscopy was Dr. ; . Fluid Overload: This was likely secondary to her underlying liver disease and initial aggressive fluid resuscitation. Initially, an anasarcic state was noted. After hemodynamic stability was obtained, she was commenced on spirinolactone and furosemide. The patient was near euvolemic on discharge, with no extremitiy edema and no detectable ascitic fluid. Code/Communication: The house staff and case management teams had many conversations with the family in regards to the patient's poor prognosis in light of her multiple medical problems (end stage liver disease, current alcohol abuse, bleeding varices, and likely NSCLC. The family and team felt further aggressive therapy would not be warranted and she was made DNR/DNI on . Her daughter ] had been the main contact for these discussions.

However, immunoperoxidase studies show the tumor to be CK, CDX (very focally positive; ER and PR stains are positive as well; TTF- and CK are negative. This immunophenotype is not typical of colonic carcinoma; ovarian origin is a consideration. Brief Hospital Course: . Hemoptysis and Left Lung Mass: The patient has a known lung mass found on CT scan at Hospital and chronic cough with acute onset of worsening hemoptysis. The patient was referred to a cardiothoracic surgeon at to evaluate the lung mass and had an appointment scheduled for next week. However, her recent onset of hemoptysis is concerning for bronchial arterial invasion with the potential of causing massive hemoptysis. The differential diagnosis for her lung mass include: malignancy vs. extramedullary plasmacytoma vs.yloidosis. On admission, the patient was hemodynamically stable with a HCT of , stable vital signs, and satting in the high 's on room air. To further evaluate her lung mass, a bronchoscopy with tumor excision was performed and the specimen was sent to pathology. During the procedure, a large blood clot was removed which extended halfway up the L mainstem bronchus. Following the evacuation of the blood clot there was active bleeding and the patient was intubated to secure her airway. She was transferred to the ICU overnight for observation. She was subsequently extubated the following day (. During her hospitalization, the patient's aspirin was held in light of her active bleeding. We continued to hold it until when she will be seen by interventional pulmonary and thoracic oncology in case a procedure is planned. Also of note, the patient's WBC increased from to . and there was concern for post obstructive pneumonia based on bronchoscopy. She was started on empiric treatment with Flagyl and ceftriaxone for suspected post-obstructive pneumonia with community-acquired pneumonia and anaerobe coverage. A sputum gram stain and culture were sent and were contaminated with oropharygeal flora.

As you know, you have a large lung mass on the left side, so the Interventional Pulmonologists placed a scope into your lungs and removed part of the obstructing mass. This tissue was sent to pathology for testing. While the Pulmonologists were looking into your lungs they decided to keep a breathing tube in overnight to ensure that you would not have any problems with breathing in case it were to start bleeding again. You spent one night in the Intensive Care Unit just to make sure that you did not continue to bleed from the tumor site in your lungs. The results from the lung mass biopsy have not returned yet, however, your thoracic surgeon will go over these results with you when they return. You were also started on antibiotics for a possible pneumonia that may have been developing in the part of the lung beyond the lung mass. The following changes were made to your medications. - Please START taking Cefpodoxime mg by mouth twice a day for more days (last day . Your first dose will be tonight - Please START taking Metronidazole mg by mouth three times a day for more days (last day .

Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Mr. is a yo male with PMH as listed above who presents with odontoid fracture and hypotension. His admission was complicated by MRSA parotitis and MRSA bacteremia. He failed evaluation by speech and swallow secondary to aspiration. The patient made it clear to family and the medical team that he did not want any ""tubes"" or to be kept alive by a machine. He had an episode on when he desaturated to the low 's with SBP in the s. He declined intubation and transfer to the MICU. His goals of care were advanced to CMO. Below is a brief summary of his hospital course by problem. . Hypotension: The patient was found to be hypotensive with SBPs~ in ED. He was given L of NS and BP now in 's. Per PCP's office and OSH records, baseline SBP is -'s. Of note, he was recently admitted to OSH with hypotension and dizziness. He had multiple imaging tests as described above, none of which were very revealing. Despite this, there was concern for possible underlying infection given his leukocytosis with WBC elevated to . He was found to have parotitis with cultures positive for MRSA. He also had positive blood cultures for MRSA. . MRSA bacteremia/parotitis: As above. He was started on vancomycin. He received mg vancomycin on due to communication errors (dose should have been and his dose was elevated on to . Given his depressed renal function and decreased ability to clear the vancomycin, he will likely have the antibiotic in his system at a supra/therapeutic level for several days. His vancomycin level on discharge was .. To receive one dose tonight ( and one final dose on . . Odontoid fracture: Patient found to have odontoid fracture as a result of a mechanical fall. He was transferred to for further management. He was seen by Dr. (ortho-spine who did not feel that the patient is candidate for halo given his age and morbidity associated with this procedure. Therefore, it was decided to treat conservatively with cervical collar. When goals of care were changed to CMO, the patient requested to have the collar removed. He is fully aware of the potential risks associated with this. . Bilateral pleural effusions: Patient has history of bilateral pleural effusions since as per OSH records. He presented on this admission with predominantly R sided effusion, which is likely loculated on his CXR. He admits to productive cough over past few weeks but denies any fevers, chills, or other systemic symptoms. It was thought most likely secondary to CHF and no further work-up was pursued. . Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient is known to have renal insufficiency, thought to be secondary to tubulointerstitial nephritis and longstanding hypertension. Per OSH reports, he is refusing dialysis. He confirmed his decision on admission. . Hyponatremia/Hypernatremia: He presented with Na~ on admission. Baseline Na per OSH records is in mid-high 's. Patient appeared volume overloaded on physical exam, and his hyponatremia was thought most likely secondary to underlying CHF. Could also be abnormal in light of CRI. Over the course of admission, the patient became hypernatremic, likely secondary to volume depletion due to decreased PO intake. He was repleted gently withF given his low EF and Na was slowly trending back down. . Anion gap metabolic acidosis: He also presented with an elevated anion gap of . Uremia is the most likely cause given elevated creatinine. He had a normal lactate. . CHF: Patient known to have dilated cardiomyopathy. Recent echo reveals EF~-%. He is on diuretics as outpatient. There is also evidence of volume overload which is suggested by bilateral LE edema. His recent complaint of dizziness and chronic hypotension is likely due to underlying CHF and very poor cardiac output. Home indapanide was held for hypotension. . Atrial fibrillation: Patient in sinus rhythm on admission. Per OSH records he self converts in and out of AF. s/p ICD placement at . He has been anticoagulated in the past but was stopped secondary to severe bleeding. Well rate controlled. Patient on Amiodarone as outpatient. Amiodarone was continued. . COPD: Per recent PFTs has severe restrictive and obstructive disease at baseline. He is on several inhalers as an outpatient. He has excellent oxygen saturations on physical exam. He was treated here with atrovent nebs. . Type DM: Last hemoglobin AC ~.. Diet controlled at home. He was controlled by a humalog insulin sliding scale here. . Hypothyroidism: Patient on Levoxyl as outpatient. Per OSH records he has been found to be subtherapeutic. He was continued on levothyroxine at mcg daily. . GERD/hiatal hernia: He was continued on a PPI, as per his outpatient regimen. . Comfort care: Goals of care were advanced to comfort measures only. His medication regimen was adjusted accordingly but all PO meds and antibiotics continued. ICD was deactivated by EP. He is written for PO liquid morphine, though he continues to deny symptoms of pain. He is being transferred to for hospice care.

153335.0,": : Service: Thoracic Surgery HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an -year-old female with a complex past medical history notable for subglottic stenosis with a long-term tracheostomy who presented for elective placement of tracheostomy tube on . The patient has been followed on an ongoing basis by the Thoracic Service and Otolaryngology Service for chronic laryngeal tracheitis with an associated edematous subglottic area which has caused complete obstruction in the area of the glottis. The patient has since been dependent on a tracheostomy for proper respiration and has been unable to speak secondary to her edema. The patient requested a revision of her tracheal stoma with attempted tracheostomy tube placement in hopes of promoting an open airway. The patient was subsequently scheduled for this procedure to be conducted through a combined effort of the Thoracic Service and the Otolaryngology Service on . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: . Aortic stenosis; status post bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement. . Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery bypass graft in . . Hypertension. . Status post cardiovascular with some residual left-sided weakness. . Hypothyroidism. . Diabetes. . Depression. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Medications on admission included Lipitor, Levoxyl, Atrovent, albuterol, glyburide, and Nexium. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: No history of tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. HOSPITAL COURSE: On the patient underwent a direct laryngoscopy with biopsy, tracheal stoma revision with removal of granulation tissue, and placement of a tracheostomy tube. The procedure was a combined effort between the Thoracic Service (represented by Dr. and the Ear/Nose/Throat Service (represented by Dr. . The patient's tracheostomy tube was placed without major difficulty; during which time the patient was ventilated with the intermittent us of jet ventilation as well as ventilation through the tracheostomy tube connector. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any intraoperative complications and was subsequently transferred to the Recovery Room in stable condition. Shortly following arrival in the Recovery Room, the patient was noted to have diminished oxygen saturations with an increasing oxygen requirement. On physical examination, no breath sounds were auscultated on the patient's left side. A STAT chest-ray was obtained which demonstrated a left-sided tension pneumothorax. A left-sided chest tube was placed on an emergent basis with adequate immediate decompression of the left hemithorax with subsequent lung reinflation confirmed by follow-up chest-ray. During the course of this episode, the patient was noted to have elevated systolic blood pressures in the s to range with associated sinus tachycardia. The patient was subsequently sedated and successfully bronched with mechanical ventilation subsequently provided via her tracheal site. The patient was subsequently transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and management. Post episode laboratory studies demonstrated an elevated troponin to .. A follow-up electrocardiogram demonstrated new T wave inversions in leads, aVF, and V to V. A Cardiology consultation was obtained, and the patient was begun on an aspirin and heparin drip; as per standard myocardial infarction protocol. An echocardiogram obtained on postoperative day one demonstrated no evidence of cardiac kinetic compromise compared to prior cardiac studies, and the patient demonstrated gradually decreasing troponin profiles over the ensuing days. On postoperative day two, the patient was noted to experience acute respiratory distress secondary to dislodgment of her tracheostomy tube connector from her surgical site. The patient's tracheostomy tube was subsequently removed and replaced with a Portex tracheostomy without difficulty. The patient remained on a standard tracheostomy for the duration of her stay without subsequent replacement of her tracheostomy tube. On the evening on postoperative day two, the patient was noted to demonstrate an acute drop in her hematocrit from . to .. Following placement of a nasogastric tube, bright red blood was aspirated from the patient's epigastrium despite vigorous lavage. A Gastrointestinal consultation was obtained and recommended vigorous resuscitation with fluid and blood products in conjunction with discontinuation of the patient's aspirin and heparin therapy. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy conducted on the morning on postoperative day three demonstrated erosions in the stomach body and fundus in conjunction with blood in the fundus, but no obvious sources of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient was thereafter noted to stabilize her hematocrit following fluid and blood product resuscitation. No additional episodes of acute gastrointestinal bleeding throughout the duration of her stay. The patient was thereafter begun on total parenteral nutrition secondary to her requirement for enteral sparing during her recovery window period. With stabilization, the patient was gradually weaned from her sedation and successfully extubated on postoperative day three. Upon the weaning of the patient's sedation, it was noted that the patient was lethargic and minimally responsive. In addition, the patient was noted to be hypertensive with systolic blood pressures in the range. A computed tomography scan of the head was obtained which demonstrated findings consistent with a recent left frontoparietal infarction which was noted to be accompanied by moderate brain parenchymal edema and mild mass effect on repeat computerized axial tomography two days later. A Neurology consultation was obtained, at which point the patient was noted to have diminished ability to move the right side of her body and diminished right-sided sensation. Upon evaluation, the patient's stroke was believed to be secondary to an embolic phenomenon given her recent history of myocardial infarction, her past history of atrial fibrillation, and the recent reversal of her anticoagulation. It was recommended that the patient be kept at a systolic blood pressure of greater than to maximize cerebral blood flow and to maintain on a propofol drip to minimize possible seizure activity. In addition, the patient was started on low-dose aspirin therapy following consultation with Gastrointestinal Service.

CV: Pt was admitted to the CCU directly from the OSH and continued on Linezolid, and started on Gentamycin for UTI. He was hemodynamically stable, requiring no pressors, and had no chest pain on arrival. On the morning after admission he developed chest pain and was started on heparin and taken to the catheterization lab where he was found to have LMA, LCx, and LAD disease with RCA occlusion. A IABP was placed to increase perfusion. After extensive discussion with the CT surgery team, who felt that the surical mortality risk was %, it was decided that the pt would be taken for PCI. At the second cardiac catheterization, pt received kissing stents to LAD and LCx. It was recommended that he have a relook catheterization in then months. He tolerated the procedure well and was taken off thye balloon pump shortly after catheterization. The patient's cardiovascular medications were titrated to give him the maximum medical benefit. He was placed on ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril. He tolerated these medications well. He had only one more episode of chest pain, rated , which occurred during dialysis, and resolved within minutes on its own. He had no EKG changes at that time. Because he has drug-eluting stents, he should remained on Plavix for at least months. His EF at the OSH was reportedly %. In approximately three weeks, the patient will need a repeat TTE to evaluate for interval change in his EF. His volume status was maintained at hemodialysis. He remained in sinus rhythm throughout his stay, but was often tachycardic. We were unable to decrease his beta-blocker any more, because his blood pressure was often around /. His tachycardia may also have been due to pain his sacral ulcers. . . : In regards to the UTI, the pt has had a history of recurrent UTIs which in the past required the removal of his bladder, and placement of a neobladder and urostomy. From the OSH, he had cultures of his urine which grew VRE and proteus. The proteus was sensitive only to gentamicin and cefuroxime. He was treated with gentamicin for the proteus, and Linezolid for the VRE (/ day course completed. He remained afebrile throughout his hospital course at OSH. Pt complained of pain at the site of ulcers at his buttocks. Plastic surgery was consulted, and his ulcers were debrided and treated with enzyme based dressings. Plastic surgery felt that these ulcers were unlikely to be the source of his sepsis at OSH. They recommend continuation of T dressing changes and to consider a rectal tube to protect the dressing/tube. He will need re-evaluation by plastic surgery for a possible flap in the future. . . Sacral decubitis ulcers: The patient has stage ulcers on his R and L buttocks. These were debrided at the bedside several times by plastic surgery. They felt that a flap may be necessary in the future, but was not indicated during this hospitalization. He also developed an intramuscular abscess next to his ulcer, which was incised and drained by plastics. This fluid grew proteus (not enough for sensitivities and pseudomonas. Because the patient remained afebrile, it was decided to not treat him for these, as he is likely to be colonized. . . Renal: The patient was kept on his Mon, Wed, Fri hemodialysis schedule. He was also kept on nephrocaps, and his phos-lo was changed to Renagel as he has a history of calciphylaxis with phos-lo. He takes prednisone at home for his failed renal graft, with the thought being that it should prevent him from developing an immune response to alloantigens that would subsequently prevent him from tolerating another transplant. He was tapered to a home dose of mg prednisone. . . Anemia: As the patient was admitted with ACS and significant CAD, the transfusion criteria remained >. As the patient remained on ASA and plavix for his cardiac stents he remained at high risk for bleeding and was monitored closely with transfusions PRN to maintain Hct >. A. The patient had episodes of hemoptysis on . These consisted of coughing up small ( cm blood clots. He did not cough up any bright red blood. On further questioning, the patient reported having a nosebleed earlier that day. In terms of his respiratory status, he was kept on his outpatient inhalers.

The patient was taken off the NC as his oxygen saturation remained >% on RA and was given a nasal spray with good effect. He remained without further episodes of hemoptysis or nose bleeds for > days. B. The patient was also noted to have guaiac positive stool/BRBPR (little flecks of blood on . On rectal exam he was noted to have some external hemorrhoids, although none were found to be bleeding at the time. However, as the patient had just had a cardiac catheterization in the setting of acute coronary syndrome, a colonoscopy was deferred. As he remained hemodynamically stable and Hct was mostly steady, it was decided that the risk of colonoscopy outweighed the benefits in the immediate setting. Recommend outpatient colonoscopy to better evaluate his source of BRBPR. . . Endocrine: The patient was kept on an insulin sliding scale for his diabetes.

He was empirically treated with oseltamivir for days though his DFA and BAL respiratory viral screen were negative. He was also noted to have some cardiac ischemia thought secondary to demand, cardiology was consulted and they felt that he would likely benefit from cardiac catheterization after he is stabilized to define his anatomy. He was treated medically for his cardiac ischemia. On admission he was in shock which was initially thought to be cardiac secondary to pulmonary hypertension and he was tried on inhaled nitric oxide but did not improve his vigileo cardiac output. He was started oniodarone for AFib with RVR and hypotension, his blood pressure improved with transition into regular atrial flutter with a slower rate. He was maintained on a heparin drip and started on coumadin on , and heparin was discontinued on . He was treated for septic shock from influenza with pressors and then a ventilator associated pneumonia. He developed acute on chronic renal failure and was initiated on CVVH through a temporary line. He defervesced and slowly improved from a ventilatory standpoint, and he was also weaned from pressors after needing a small dose for > week. A tracheostomy was performed as pt. did not appear to be able to wean from the vent in the short term. He again began spiking fevers and blood cultures grew out VRE / bottles so his central lines were changed and his HD line was changed as well. He was started on linezolid and continued to spike fevers. He was also noted to be rigid on exam and so his buproprion and prozac were discontinued for fear of serotonin syndrome. His linezolid was changed to daptomycin out of concern for linezolid contributing to serotonin syndrome. His rigidity and fevers slowly improved. He was continued on dapto/meropenem for a total of a / day course respectively, both finishing on . . However, his fevers continued after discontinuation of the above antibiotics. Further sputum cultures revealed stenotrophomonas, that was intermediately sensitive to ceftazidime but sensitive to Bactrim. He was noted to have a sulfa drug allergy which his wife thought was a rash but had never seen as it occured before they were married. Per infectious disease, even the combination of ceftazidime and levofloxacin would be inferior to Bactrim so he was given one test dose of DS tab of Bactrim. After hours of observation, he exhibited no rash so he was started on treatment dose for planned day course, started on . His fevers began to completely resolve. Lines were removed during fever workup. . After resolution of his fevers a tunnelled dialysis line was placed as he showed no signs of renal recovery and would likely be dialysis dependent. He was able to tolerate long periods of trach mask at the time of discharge but was still not completely independent from the vent.

IMPRESSION: Multiple hemorrhagic masses consistent with hemorrhagic metastatic foci in the left frontal, the right frontal, left pons, and right occipital lobes. Brief Hospital Course: A year-old woman with h/o NSCLC on Tarceva presented with slurred speech and left-sided facial droop, found to have multiple brain mets with surrounding hemorrhage and edema on head CT, now transferred to oncologic medicine from neurosurgury for whole brainRT. . METASTATIC NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER The multiple hemorrhagic brain mets were stable on imaging per neurosurgery; her coagulopathy was reversed with vitamin K and FFP, and her coumadin was held. She was started on steroids at a dose of mg QH. She was also started on Keppra and Dilantin given concern of seizure activity in the ED at the OSH. There was concern that hypertension might exacerbate the intracranial bleeding, and thus her SBP was tightly controlled to maintain SBP <. . Once stabilized, the patient started whole brainRT. She will undergo a series of radiation treatments in total. The treatments will end on . Directions are outlined in the discharge orders. . Her symptoms gradually improved. Her speech became less slurred and more clear. Strength in her upper and lower extremities returned and her balance improved. She should follow-up with her primary oncologist in to discuss treatment options. She will have follow-up with Dr. in late for re-imaging of her brain. . SEIZURE PROPHYLAXIS She has been treated with Dilantin and Keppra. Her dilantin has been uptitrated to therapeutic serum levels at a dose of mg twice daily. Her Keppra should be increased from the current dose of mg to mg QAM and mg QPM (on . This should be continued until at which point the dose can be increased to mg . Once the dose of Keppra is mg , the dilantin can be decreased by mg each day and then stopped completely. . PULMONARY EMBOLISM This was diagnosed in the summer of , according to the patient. Although she arrived at the hospital on anticoagulation with a therapeutic INR of ., there was significant concern that her anticoagulation would worsen the brain parenchymal bleeding. Thus her INR was reversed and her coumadin held. If as she says her pulmonary embolism occurred months ago, there is no emergent need for anticoagulation at this time, and certainly the bleeding risks outweigh the benefits. . PAROT GLAND SWELLING Two days after starting whole brainRT, she developed swelling in the region of the right parotid gland. We sent for an amylase that came back at . We believe that she has suffered radiation-related parotitis. We treated her symptoms with warm compresses and artificial saliva to help stimulate the gland and promote secretion of excess parotid fluid. . HYPERTENSION We continued her home valsartan and ToprolL. Hydralazine was used as needed to keep her SBP <. . HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA We continued her home statin. .. She was kept on a normal diet. Pneumoboots were used for prophylaxis, and her home dose PPI provided prophylaxis against stress ulcers. Her code status is full code.

Successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the bifurcating obtuse marginal branch was performed proximal to the bifurcation but distal to the previously placed stent. The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit where she experienced a prolonged intubation due to persistent sedation. Neurology was consulted, and a magnetic resonance imaging was done which was nondiagnostic secondary to motion defect. An electroencephalogram was done as well showing nonspecific flowing pattern. As no other organic causes were found, the patient's prolonged sedation was felt to be a result of a hypoxic brain injury. All sedatives were held, and one week after being unresponsive even to painful stimuli, the patient began to awaken. She was extubated successfully and had rapid improvement. During her intubation, the patient spiked a fever and was pan cultured. She was found to have sputum positive for levofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

The patient was sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the emergency department because of increased oxygen requirement. . Her MICU course was notable for an ongoing AG and non-AG acidosis attributed to the combination of renal failure/ketosis and diarrhea, which has since improved with HD , lessening diarrhea, bicarb, and lasix. She also had an ongoing respiratory acidosis from hypercarbia, likely underlying poor lung reserve and fatigue. She required BiPAP several times during her course for ventilation assistance. Intubation was considered at several points, but was not required. and renal were involved in the care of this patient. CT studies of the abdomen were unremarkable for an infectious source. Blood, urine cultures were negative while patient was in the MICU. Stool cultures were also negative. The patient was continued empirically on levo/flagyl for a presumed GI source, given diarrhea. Urine legionella was negative. CMV and EBV were checked given immunosuppression, but were negative. Her course was also notable for a fluid overload state given evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR and exam, requiring agressive diuresis with lasix gtt and chlorothiazide. After her diarrhea, fever, ARF and metabolic acidosis improved, she was transferred to medicine floor for further care with a . L oxygen requirement. . Fever - resolved after transfer to the medical service. Blood cultures from subsequently grew Coag negative staph (sensitivities pending from the central line site. The central line was d/c'd and the patient was started on vancomycin empirically ( gram dosed for daily levels<. Surveillance cultures remained negative, patient remained stable without a fever or white count. The positive cultures may be contamination, but it is unclear. She was treated with days of vancomycin and transitioned to oral therapy with Doxycycline for a further days on discharge. Her urine on also grew out <, Enterococcus senstive to vanc andpicillin. Although this is not a true UTI as it is less than <, and her u/a was sterile, it was decided to treat with vanc as she is a renal transplant patient. Given her CRI, she should be dosed mg/qd and have levels checked in days to ensure therapeutic levels - done for days as above, and no evidence UTI on d/c.

He was recently discharged from the hospital after a long course of treatment for Klebsiella bacteremia from hepatic abscesses and obstructive cholangitis and issues with enteral feedings. He was seen at Dr. clinic last Friday, at which time his pigtail drains were removed, because the previous abscesses had resolved, although new smaller ones, notenable to drainage were noted. He was to continue his antibiotics for more weeks after drain removal. . He now returns from with a reported Hct of . He reports feeling fatigued, more from baseline.

There are new ill-defined hypodense lesions within the lateral right hepatic lobe, which are suspicious for new foci of infection given the short interval time course. There is a tiny new fluid collection in the right lateral abdominal wall in the area of prior drain, measuring approximately .cm maximally. Otherwise, no new fluid collections are identified. . Portable Abdominal-Ray: Only a supine portable view of the abdomen is submitted for interpretation, precluding assessment for free intraperitoneal air. Considering the clinical concern, either a fully upright or left lateral decubitus view would be recommended. A percutaneous feeding tube is present terminating in the expected location of the jejunum. A non-obstructive bowel gas pattern is visualized. . CXR: Interval placement of right subclavian catheter terminating in the lower SVC with no evidence of pneumothorax. Examination is otherwise unchanged since the recent study except for development of linear atelectasis at the left lung base. . ECG: TRACING SUBMITTED LATE AND OUT OF SEQUENCE. Rhythm is probably sinus tachycardia but consider also possible atrial tachycardia given the markedly rapid rate. Probable left anterior fascicular block. QTc interval may be prolonged but is difficult to measure. Modest ST-T wave changes. Findings are non-specific. Clinical correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of marked tachycardia is now present and modest ST-T wave changes are seen. Intervals Axes: Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T / - . MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC: Correlation is made with prior CT performed on . FINDINGS: Again noted are multiple peripherally enhancing hepatic fluid collections containing foci of gas consistent with abscesses. Allowing for differences in technique, these are not significantly changed in size, and no new collections are identified. For example, the collection within segmentI posteriorly measures . . cm in its entirety, with the central fluid component measuring . . cm. The central fluid component on prior CT measured . . cm. The collection within segment measures . . cm in its entirety, with the anterior central fluid component measuring . . cm. This is difficult to compare to the prior CT, but appears stable to smaller. There are two foci of enhancement within the right lateral abdominal wall in the site of prior drainage catheter tracts. There are no focal fluid collections within the abdominal wall. Again noted are postsurgical changes from Whipple procedure. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. MRCP images are limited, but there is no obvious focal stricture. The remaining pancreas is atrophic and the pancreatic duct is mildly prominent. There are stable retroperitoneal lymph nodes. There are bilateral nonenhancing renal cysts. A cyst within the posterior left renal mid pole is bright on T pre-contrast images, consistent with hemorrhagic or proteinaceous fluid. The left kidney is mildly atrophic compared to the right. There is mild diffuse anasarca. Susceptibility artifact is noted in the anterior abdominal wall from multiple surgical clips. The spleen and adrenal glands are normal. The visualed abdominal bowel loops are nondilated, and there is no ascites or new focal fluid collection. Limited images of the lower chest demonstrate loculated right pleural fluid and atelectasis and minimal left pleural fluid. The visualized bone marrow signal is unremarkable. A percutaneous jejunostomy tube is identified. Multiplanar reformations and subtraction images provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series. IMPRESSION: . Multiple hepatic abscesses, not significantly changed in size given differences in technique. No new fluid collections are identified. There is enhancement within the right lateral abdominal wall in the region of prior drainage catheters, without focal fluid collection. . Stable post-surgical changes from Whipple, with no evidence of biliary dilatation. . Bilateral renal cysts. Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on for evaluation of the aforementioned problem. was continued on a regular diet with supplements, cycled tubefeeds via the J-Tube, which enters the duodenum via a EC fistual, on home medications and oral antibiotics, the latter consisting of Ciprofloxacin, Clindamycin, and Linezolid. These antibiotics were prescribed during his last admission for abdominal abscesses, which grew out Pseudomonas, MRSA and beta Strep. Upon admission, his HGB was . and HCT ., for which he was transfused units of PRBCs without adverse event. Nutrition, Ostomy Nurse, Physical Therapy, and Occupational Therapy were consulted early during this admission. Infectious Disease also followed the patient during the admission. Overall, the patient was hemodynamically stable. On HD, the patient received an additional unit of PRBCs responding with a HGB of . and HCT of .. Urine and blood cultures were sent. He was given supplemental hydration with Lactated Ringer's via the J-Tube. Tolerated tubefeeds at goal, but only fair intake of his diet. Early on , the patient became hypotensive, acutely confused and briefly unresponsive. He was transferred to the SICU. A CXR, ECG, labwork, and blood cultures were performed. A foley catheter and A-line were placed. The EKG was unremarkable, and the CXR showed moderate (R pleural effusion increased, rightward mediastinal shift with opacification in (R lower lobe most likely representing atelectasis. He was given a L LR bolus with good response. He was started on Flagyl for possible colitis. A Abdominal/pelvic CT with contrast demonstrated interval improvement in the hepatic fluid collection and a few small new collection less than .cm in size. Trophic tubefeeds were started. The next SICU day, his diet was restarted and trophic tubefeeds continued. He experienced another episode of hypotension on , and was again bolused with a total of mL LR with good response. Tubefeeds were again held. A CVL was placed, and Cefepime was added for temperature spikes to cover Pseudomonas. On , he remained hemodynamically stable. He was restarted on tubefeeds, this time continuous advancing to goal, which he tolerated. Given that he continued stable into , he was transferred back to the inpatient floor. Early on , the patient again experienced an episode of confusion. Heart rate was tachy between -, other vital signs were stable. No fever or leukocytosis. Labwork, blood and urine cultures were sent. Later that morning, his mental status returned to baseline. On , the patient underwent MRCP, which revealed multiple hepatic abscesses, but not significantly changed in size given differences in technique, and no new fluid collections. Given these finding demonstrating overall improvement and potential risks of interventional biospy, it was ultimately determined in consultation with Infectious Disease to forego planned ultrasound-guided aspiration and biopsy of one or more of the liver abscesses. Infectious Disease continued to follow along, updating antibiotic recommendations. On , Cefepime, Clindamycin, and Cipro were discontinued, with the patient continued on Flagyl. The Lineolid was completed on . The Flagyl will be continued until outpatient Infectious Disease follow-up appointment on . Other than that mentioned above, the hospital course back on the floor was unremarkable. Hebulated early and frequently with Nursing or Physical Therapy, was adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive spirrometry, and actively participated in the plan of care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay. The patient's blood sugar was monitored regularly throughout the stay; sliding scale insulin was administered when indicated. His labwork was monitored regularly; electolytes repleted when needed. After his foley was discontinued, he voided without problem with an adequate urine output. He tolerated cycled tubefeeds via the J-Tube and a regular diet. Marinol was added on to stimulate his appetite. He was also started on Viokase and Imodium PRN for loose stools with improvement. At the time of discharge on , the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular diet, although with poor intake,bulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled. He was tolerating cycled tubefeeds via the J-Tube, placed through the EC fistula. The ostomy appliance as ordered remained intact. The patient was discharged to an extended care facility.

Of note, had been on levoquin and flagyl for unclear reasons at Rehab for sometime before admission to . Aggressive fluid rescucitation and pressors in ICU. Pt was taken off pressors two days after admission, and remained afebrile throughout. PICC line removed, foley catheter changed. Blood, urine, and midline cultures remained no growth throughout but were of little value given antibiotic therapy preceding cultures. Plastic surgery evaluated sacral decubs and did not feel they were likely source of sepsis. MRI of sacral decubs without evidence of sepsis. C. diff considered, no samples sent in ICU and then on floor, no stool for sample. Influenza negative. Appropriate adrenal response on stim testing. Patient to receive two week course of vancomycin/meropenem given septicemia without source.

ACUTE ISSUES Acute Systolic Heart Failure: She had a reported EF of % on which was % on TTE done at OSH. With her chronic angina, we suspected coronary artery disease as likely etiology. The differential also included infectious cardiomyopathy, toxic cardiomypathy, endocrine dysfunction and stress induced cardiomypathy. Patient was initially diuresed with lasix and metolazone and put out adequate urine. She was transiently hypotensive so further diuresis was held. Given there was a troponin leak at the OSH (and small elevation initially here, a cardiac cath was considered to look for CAD as the trigger for her CHF. However, there was concern in regards to viability of her left ventricle, and also as to whether there was a thrombus present so a cardiac MRI was obtained. This study found no LV thrombus and did find viable cardiac tissue. She was then prepped for cath with steroids and benadryl given her previous contrast allergy. Her cath results from showed no coronary disease, etiology of acute CHF likely stress cardiomyopathy/embolism from A fib to coronary/myocarditis. With improved EF improved % making stress cardiomyopathy the likely etiology of her actue CHF The patient went home on Lisinopril MetoprololL . She was given pills of mg lasix IN CASE she starts gaining weight in the interim before her follow up appointment with Dr. . R lower ext pain: Pt began complaining of R LE pain after transfer to the floor. She described it as diffuse and worse upon lifting her leg. Her CPK was originally on and uptrended to on . We had initially started her on atorvastatin mg daily in house, but d/ced the medication once she was symptomatic. Also taken down for LENIs and ABI and found to have completely intact arterial and venous flow. On further examination, a large right upper leg hematoma was discovered. CPK downtrended to the s and her heparin was d/ced. CORONARIES: She has a history of chronic stable angina however appears to have been getting progressively worse. With slight elevation of cardiac enzymes concern for NSTEMI however no EKG changes were noted. Likely etiology of enzymes are demand in the setting of extreme volume overload. We continued aspirin mg daily, ACE-i, statin RHYTHM: She has a history of atrial fibrillation which is currently rate controlled. She declined being on coumadin. CHADS is at least with CHF, HTN, Age and diabetes. She would benefit from anticoagulation however given recent though bleed we felt that she would benefit from starting anticoagulation in an outpatient setting. Hyponatremia: Paitent had a low Na down into . This resolved during hospital stay. CHRONIC ISSUES Hypertension: was well controlled on current regimen. .

You were transferred to the from because of several days of shortness of breath. It had been determined that your heart was not contracting as forcefully as is normal. This caused fluid to back up into your lungs and in turn caused your shortness of breath. We gave you medications to get rid of this excess fluid and help you breathe more easily. Furthermore, you received a catheterization later in your hospital course that showed that the contractility of your heart had improved. Because you have been laying down in the hospital for so long and in addition because you have fluid in your lungs, you will go home with a physical therapist scheduled to work with you to help regain your strength. In addition, imaging of your leg to look at the size of your bruise showed a fluid collection next to your hernia. You and your primary care physician can discuss this on an office visit. Your sodium level was temporarily low, but this resolved with fluid restriction. Several of your medications have changed. You can refer to the medication discharge list attached to this form, but in brief: START: MetoprololL mg - this is a medication to help your heart. You were previously taking a lower dose. Please increase it to mg daily. Furosemide (Lasix mg daily by mouth only as needed IF your daily weight increases kg from your weight at discharge from the hospital or if you become short of breath. If you have to take these pills, call Dr. office to see if he can see you sooner than your regularly scheduled appointment on (see below. Lisinopril mg daily- this is a medication to help your heart STOP: Isosorbide mg twice daily CHANGE: MetoprololL mg daily to MetoprololL mg by mouth daily When you see your phyisician, please discuss the idea of taking coumadin.

GI: GI bleed/necrosis pancreas/ileus - NGT to suction, NPO, Protonix , serial abdominal exams. T-bili was slightly elevated at . on admission. Amylase and Lipase were also elevated. His CAT scan revealed a grossount of retroperitoneal air and this tracked down into the right testicular region and was entirely consistent with pancreatic necrosis gone afoul. The patient suffered signs of sepsis including atrial fibrillation and respiratory distress in the day prior to this operation and he underwent exploration for management. He went to the OR on for: . Exploratory laparotomy. . Retroperitoneal exploration and drainage of abscess. . Open cholecystectomy. . Duodenostomy tube placement. . G-tube placement. . J-tube placement. He went to the OR on for: . Incision, drainage and debridement of right inguinal canal and the suprapubic space. . Incision and drainage of scrotum. He went for EGD on PPD and this showed a single ulcer large ulcer was found in the duodenum on the medial wall extending from the duodenal bulb to the second portion of the duodenum. The ulcer was partially obscured by debris and necrotic material but there was a suggestion of ischemia with no obvious mass and no bleeding. He was also complaining of right inguinal pain. An US showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm. Loops of bowel corresponding to point of patient's maximal tenderness. He was noted to have progressive scrotal swelling. A CT the next day showed a right hydrocele. A repeat CT scan demonstrated evidence of fluid tracking through the inguinal canal from a retroperitoneal collection into the scrotum. It was determined that he needed to go to OR for washout and drainage. The wound was packed with WTD dressings and we intermittently used a wound vac to help with healing. Repeat Abd CT on showed gastric contrast appears to have traversed duodenum with a decrease collection within R abd wall-->R scrotum. Upon discharge, the patient's wound is healing very nicely, and we are continuing with WTD dressing changes. H.pylori was negative. Delerium: Possibly related to EtOH withdrawl. He had one unwitnessed fall when trying to get out of bed. He had family at the bedside during the day for reorientation and sitter at night. Geriatrics was consulted for the delirium and recommendations followed FEN: A PICC was placed on and TPN initiated. TPN was discontinued and the patient's tube feeds were advanced to cc/hr.

Intubation secondary to traumatic brain injury OPERATIVE PROCEDURES: Intubation HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a year old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, prostate hypertrophy, L-S disc herniation and bilateral lower extremity claudication, left greater than right. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: . Appendectomy; . Umbilical hernia repair MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Lescol and Doxazosin mg once a day and Aspirin. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Examination on admission revealed the patient was agitated and combative with coma scale of . He had dried blood in both nares. His face was stable. His oropharynx had dried blood in it. His heart was regular. His lungs were clear. His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended. His lower extremities were warm with an abrasion over the left lateral thigh. He had palpable pulses bilaterally. His rectal was heme negative, guaiac heme negative, normal tone. His pelvis was stable. His back revealed no stepoff and no deformities. He was moving all extremities well. LABORATORY DATA: On admission his hematocrit was ., his creatinine was ., his lactate was ., his urinalysis was negative. His serum toxicology was positive for an ethyl alcohol of . Hisylase was . His studies on admission revealed a negative chest-ray and a negative pelvis film. His cervical spine computerized tomography scan was negative. His abdomen and pelvis computerized tomography scan revealed aspiration in the right lower lobe, otherwise negative. His gala films were negative. His head computerized tomography scan revealed a nondisplaced occipital bone fracture with pneumocephalus, a left temporal contusion with subarachnoid hemorrhage, a right temporal bone fracture, a sphenoid sinus fracture and blood in the temporomandibular joint. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was seen and evaluated in the Emergency Department by the Trauma Team, given his brain injury he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and Neurosurgery was consulted. An A-line was placed. He underwent a four vessel angiogram on hospital day given the proximity of his fractures to the carotid and vertebral foramen. The four vessel angiogram was negative. Given his agitation and tachycardia, it was felt that the patient was going into withdrawal. He was therefore started on a CIWA protocol. On , given the fact that his mental status seemed to be slightly decreased and that he was not following commands, Neurosurgery recommended a stat head computerized tomography scan. The patient was intubated for this examination given the fact that we were not able to adequately sedate him and protect his airway at the same time for the computerized axial tomography scan, the computerized axial tomography scan revealed a largeount of frontal edema. He was started on Mannitol on hospital day . Given the fact that he was getting Mannitol and had not had an ICP monitor, this issue was revisited with Neurosurgery. They decided to discontinue the Mannitol. He seemed to be improving slightly and they felt that his prognosis was favorable. Also of note, an Otorhinolaryngology consult was obtained for his fractures near the skull base and near the auditory canal. They recommended antibiotics for the fluid in his sinuses but no further in-hospital workup. Of note, during the hospital stay the family expressed that they did not want the patient to be a full code and thus he was made Do-Not-Resuscitate, Do-Not-Intubate. They also stated that they knew that their father would not want to be on any sort of life support or have his life prolonged if he were to be anything but normal. The Intensive Care Unit Team and Trauma Team and the Neurosurgery Team felt that the patient had made some progress and it was not reasonable to withdraw care, and thus an Ethics Consult was obtained. It was decided that the patient would be Comfort-Measures-Only, that his intravenous fluids be discontinued, and he would be allowed to eat and drink if he was hungry or thirsty but that he would receive no further medications and would be made hospice. This plan was enacted, however, the patient did continue to improve to the point where he was following commands and able to eat at discharge. Physical therapy felt that he had good potential for rehabilitation and thus on hospital day , , the patient was discharged to rehabilitation in stable condition. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: None.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: LP History of Present Illness: The pt. is a year-old left-handed male with a history of previous strokes, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, colon cancer who presented after a fall. The pt stated that he was in his usual state of health today. He was at work, walking down steps and stated that he ""missed the last few steps and fell down."" He did state that he felt the sensation as if he were going to fall just before he tumbled down the stairs. He missed about three stairs and landed on his right side, injuring his right knee. He denied lower extremity weakness, numbness at the time. He denied a sensation as if his legs buckled. He denied tripping over any obstructions. Again, he did state that he transiently felt lightheaded, but denied vertigo or dysequilibrium. He denied head injury, loss of consciousness as a result of the fall. A physician witnessed the event and came right to the patient's aid. EMS was called and the patient was taken to an OSH. He noted that on the way to the OSH, he was very diaphoretic and nauseous, but this later resolved. This sort of event has never happened to the patient in the past. At the OSH, an abnormality was noted on an imaging study and he was brought to the for further evaluation. The pt. denied headache, loss of vision, diplopia, dysphagia.

Pertinent Results: Radiologic Data: CT head (performed at OSH: roughly cm in diameter right parietooccipital hemorrhage, which appears acute (reviewed with radiologist on call. . Brain MRI: TECHNIQUE: T sagittal and axial and FLAIR T susceptibility and diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained. FINDINGS: There is a well-defined area of hyperintense T and T signal in the right occipitoparietal lobe with some mild surrounding edema. Following gadolinium, enhancement is seen at the anterior portion of the hemorrhage. Findings are suggestive of a mass, most likely metastasis, with associated small area of hemorrhage and mild surrounding edema. No other discrete areas of enhancement or signal abnormalities are seen. There is no mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus. The abnormality in the right parietooccipital region demonstrates slow diffusion secondary to blood products. IMPRESSION: Small mm area of hemorrhage in the right parietooccipital region with surrounding enhancement indicative of an underlying mass with mild surrounding edema. No other areas of enhancement seen. Given the peripheral location of the lesion, metastasis is considered to be the most likely diagnosis. . ; BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler ultrasound of the right and left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins was performed. There is normal flow, augmentation, compressibility, and waveforms. No intraluminal thrombus was identified. IMPRESSION: No left or right lower extremity DVT. . CT EXAMINATION OF THE CHEST, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT THE ADMINISTRATION OF INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST, AND WITH ORAL CONTRAST: INDICATION: -year-old male with right parietal lobe bleed. Assess for primary lesion. TECHNIQUE: Contiguous mm axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis with the administration of oral contrast only. Following, contiguous mm axial images were obtained from the lung apex through the abdomen with the administration of intravenous contrast bolus, as well as three-minute delayed imaging through the abdomen and pelvis. FINDINGS: No prior CT examination for comparison. Evaluation of the lungs reveals a mm calcified nodule within the right upper lobe (series , image . No other focal nodules are seen. There is atelectasis within both lung bases, left side greater than right. No focal consolidation. Evaluation of the mediastinum reveals calcified lymph nodes, likely from prior granulomatous disease. There is calcification of the proximal aspect of the LAD. There is a small pericardial effusion. The heart is not enlarged. There is calcification of the thoracic aorta. There is a moderate-sized hiatal hernia, and gas within the mid and distal esophagus. The mid esophageal wall is somewhat thickened, which could be related to reflex esophagitis, however, this would be better evaluated with endoscopy. The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are grossly normal without solid mass. Simple cysts are seen within the right kidney. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis. Calcified gallstones are seen dependently within the gallbladder. There are no dilated loops of large or small bowel. There is no free intraperitoneal gas or free fluid. There is marked enlargement of the prostate, which measures . x . cm in maximum dimension. Chunky calcifications are identified within the prostate. There is marked distention of the urinary bladder, likely related to bladder outlet obstruction from the enlarged prostate. No evidence of dilatation of the distal ureters. There are loops of small bowel within a right-sided inguinal hernia, however, there is no evidence of incarceration or inflammation. No suspicious lytic or osseous lesions are seen. IMPRESSION: . No evidence of solid mass within the chest, abdomen or pelvis. . Findings in the lungs compatible with prior granulomatous disease. . Gallstones. . Enlarged prostate, with probable bladder outlet obstruction. Correlation with PSA value recommended. . Thickened esophageal wall, better evaluated with endoscopy. . TECHNIQUE: D time-of-flight MRA of the circle of acquired. FINDINGS: The maximum intensity and source images of the MRA demonstrate normal flow signal in the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation. In the region of right parietooccipital hemorrhage, no abnormal vascular structures are seen. . HISTORY: -year-old man with previous MRI revealing a hemorrhage in the right parietooccipital lobe and mass concerning for metastases. MRA did not reveal any abnormal vasculature in this area and a body CT was unrevealing as far as a primary neoplastic process. INTERPRETATION: Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior projections and no focal abnormal uptake or penia was noted. The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer excretion. IMPRESSION: No evidence of bony metastases. . : INDICATION: -year-old man with right parietooccipital hemorrhage, likely metastatic. Assess for thyroid primary. COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: Targeted ultrasound examination of the thyroid demonstrates normal thyroid parenchyma, without evidence of nodule or mass. The left lobe measures . . . cm. The right lobe measures . . . cm. IMPRESSION: Unremarkable thyroid. . Brief Hospital Course: . Right parietooccipital hemorrhage: Not clear whether this lead to presenting symptoms, but unlikely. He was initially admitted to ICU for BP management, but was called-out to floor on HD two after BP came down on labetalol gtt. On admission, he had evidence of distal LUE weakness which quickly improved. He also had a left inferior temporal quadrantanopsia which persisted. MRI revealed enhancement underneath the bleed concerning for mass. Therefore, metastatic work-up performed which included CT torso (normal except for thickened esophagus, enlarged prostate, thyroid scan (normal. In addition, LP performed and CSF cytology negative for malignant cells. He was evaluated by both neurooncology and neurosurgery who recommended repeat CT scan and follow-up in one month. . . Blood loss anemia: The pt had progressively declining Hct over the hospital stay. Stool was guaiac positive. He also reported one episode of melena. GI was consulted and recommended EGD and colonoscopy. He was transferred to the medicine service. He received a Golytely prep overnight prior to EGD/Colonoscopy. Colonoscopy was deferred given negative colonoscopy several months prior and non-bleeding duodenal ulcer found of EGD. Hematocrits remained stable prior to discharge and patient wothout any more bleeding after EGD. . . Renal failure: On admission, the pt had a creatinine of .. This subsequently rose to .-. range despite aggressive hydration and good p.o. intake. He did receive a dye load for CT torso, but was medicated with mucormyst. Attempts were made to obtain outside records to determine baseline creatinine (given h/o diabetes and HTN, likely preexisting nephropathy. Patient declined straiht cath to determine a post-void residual. This should be followed-up as an outpatient, however, patient without urination difficulties or symptoms prior to discharge. . . HTN: BP was elevated on admission. He was originally admitted to ICU for BP control with labetalol gtt. This was eventually transitioned to p.o. metoprolol. He required titration of metoprolol and lisinopril for persistently elevated BP into the s. . . DM: The pt's fingersticks were acceptable. He was maintained on glyburide and a sliding scale of regular insulin. Metformin was held due to low creatinine clearance. .

Hemodynamic findings consistent with pericardial constriction. Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. was admitted to the on for further management of her shortness of breath. An echocardiogram was suggestive of a small pericardial effusion and pericardial constriction could not be ruled out. A CTA was performed which revealed a moderate sized pericardial effusion with stranding in the mediastinal and epicardial fat concerning for mediastinitis. Given this finding, clinical correlation for infected pericarditis was recommended. The cardiology service was consulted who recommended a pericardial window. The cardiac surgery service was consulted and on Mrs. was taken to the operating room where she underwent a pericardial window with Dr. . Please see separate dictated operative note for details. Pathology revealed organizing fibrinous pericarditis with adjacent adipose tissue has a prominent perivascular lymphocytic inflammation that is focally transmural (lymphocytic vasculitis. The latter findings raise the possibility of the spectrum of collagen vascular diseases. Viral and bacterial cultures were negative except for an indeterminate past cytomegalovirus. Postoperatively she developed rapid atrial fibrillation for which digoxin and beta blocker were given. As she remained in rapid atrial fibrillation,iodarone was started. Mrs. continued to have symptoms of constrictive pathology and an echocardiogram was performed which confirmed continued constriction. She was taken back to the catheterization lab where she was found to have single branch vessel coronary artery disease and hemodynamics strongly suggestive of constrictive physiology. Given these findings it was elected to return to the operating room. On , Mrs. was taken to the operating room where she underwent a sternotomy with pericardiectomy. Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring. She later awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. Diuresis was initiated. On , Mrs. was transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for monitoring. Amiodarone was continued for atrial fibrillation. Dr. followed Mrs. and recommended of hearts monitor on discharge. Physical therapy worked with her daily to increase her strength and mobility. Subcutaneous heparin was started as she was not asbulatory as expected. Coumadin was started for atrial fibrillation.

Work-up included an esophagoscopy which noticed a lesion in the mid-to-distal esophagus, biopsy proven to be squamous cell carcinoma, mostly in-situ but with several foci indeterminate for invasion. EUS defined a TN tumor, with a PET scan showing multiple radioactive lymph nodes, in the medistinum and bilateral cervical. ENT evaluation, including fine needle aspiration, demonstrated sinusitis with reactive lymph nodes. A staging procedure on , consisting of bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy, and EGD with gastric biopsy, was essentially negative. Accordingly, he now presents for elective resection of the primary tumor. Past Medical History: none Social History: Lives with other adult men. Brother owns/operates Chinese Food Restaurant. Nephews visit regularly.

ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender with normal bowel sounds. HEART: Regular rhythm and rate. There is no murmur or gallop. Brief Hospital Course: yo M admitted to Thoracic surgery service after undergoing transthoracic near total esophagectomy with cervical esophagogastrostomy and feeding jejunostomy on ; please see operative notes for details. Post-operatively the pt was brought to the ICU, hemodynamically stable, and extubated that evening. An epidural catheter was in place, as were chest tubes bilaterally, F jejunostomy, and a JP drain. He was transferred to the floor on POD . The chest tubes were initially placed to water seal, but developing pneumothorax prompted return to wall suction on POD . The chest tube output appeared chylous, with moderately high output and elevated triglycerides, and therefore enteral feedings were held as TPN was initiated with octreotide via a new PICC. In the meantime, the foley, epidural, and NGT were removed, a swallow study showed a tiny leak. A lymphangiogram on POD was unsuccessful at prolonged lymphatic cannulization. The high chylous chest tube output prompted a return to the OR for thoracic duct ligation on via a R thoracotomy. Briefly on Neo, he was extubated the following day and returned to the floor. Nonetheless, the chest tube output remained high, (ie, liters daily, electrolytes were corrected aggressively, and TPN continued. The patient returned to the OR on for accessory thoracic duct ligation via a L thoracotomy. At this point, there were chest tubes on each side, with intermittent pneumothorax on the R. The L posterior tube was removed with little output. On POD , , he spiked a fever with erythema noted at the epidural site; catheter tip culture revealed methicillin sensitive staph aureus and methicillin resistant staph epi; subsequent blood cultures revealed MSSA. Broad-coverage antibiotics were tailered down to just vancomycin and continued based on the first negative blood culture. The chest tube outputs had decreased from several liters to ~-cc daily each, and eventually both R chest tubes were removed. TF's via the J-tube were begun on POD , supplemented with PO full liquids, and TPN weaned off. However, the L chest tube then began having output of -cc daily, became cloudier in appearance, and demonstrated intermittent air leak. Remainder of hospital course completed by NP POD - pt on soft solid diet. TPN d/c'd and tube feed to goal. Given medium chain fatty acids withc/o diffuse abd pain with some focus in right upper quadrant. Made NPO. Abd ultrasound revealed ""plump gall bladder but no acute process. LFT's elevated-presumably from TPN which had been d/c'd. Pt reminded NPO with resolution of symptoms - tube feed and po's resumed after hrs witho further occurence of abd discomfort. LFT's continued to trend downward daily. Air leak in left chest tube resolved and output slowed and chest tube was removed witho incident. transitioned from PCA to pain med via j-tube with good effect.

Briefly, the patient injured his left lower extremity on by ""kicking a stick,"" developed increased pain/swelling/erythema and a fever of overnight, and was then brought to where he was diagnosed with cellulitis. After admission, the patient dveloped septic shock with multiorgan system failure and transferred to the ICU. Wound and blood cultures subsequently returned positive for Serratia marescens. In the ICU, he was anuric, with liver dysfunction and ""severe respiratory limitations."" For his infection, he was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftaz and levo, and his left foot was surgically debrided, leaving a yellow eschar, with silvadone dressing done afterwards. For his shock, he required norepinephrine and vasopressin that were started on and stopped on . On , the patient developed afib with RVR, was treated withiodarone drip until , after which he went in and out of afib at a rate of - on metoprolol. For his anuria, he was dialyzed on and via a pre-existing LUE AV fistula. During his last dialysis on , cc were taken off, and K of . was corrected with a . bath. Afterwards, he had UOP - cc/hr by foley, BUN and Cr .. For hypoxemia, he was placed on a BiPAP mask, and non-invasive ventilation was complicated by Stage ulcer on the bridge of his nose. ICU course was also complicated by metabolic acidosis, toxic metabolic encephalopathy with global weakness, and thrombocytopenia. . Of note, the patient has been off pressors since , and off amiodarone since . His last hemodialysis was on the morning of . Additionally, left lower extremity ABI's showed: calf ., ankle (PT ., ankle (DP ., digit .. Cr trend at Sturdy included . (on admission with peak of . upon starting dialysis on . Subsequently, Cr decreased to .. BUN was on admission, peaked at and was on transfer. WBC peaked at . and were . on transfer. Platelets had dropped from on admission, to a nadir of , and were at the time of discharge. Last tacrolimus level on was .. Wound and blood culture Serratia marescens was sensitive to ceftriaxone, cipro, ertapenem, gentamicin, imipenem, levofloxacin, tobramycin, and SXT. EKG on at OSH showed junctional tachcardia at bpm with LVH and old anterior infarct. . The patient was transferred to for further management and revision of his AV fistula, as he was difficult to dialyze through the existing one. . On the floor, his initial vital signs were T .(., HR , BP /, RR , SaO % L NC. He was somwehat sleepy and confused. He complained of pain in his left foot, but had no other complaints.

Duplex evaluation was performed of the left upper extremity surgical AV fistula. Brachial artery is patent with velocity of , anastomosis , drain vein , and . IMPRESSION: Patent left upper extremity surgical AV fistula. Mild elevation of velocity at artery-to-vein anastomosis and at the distal portion of the draining vein. Clinical correlation is warranted. CAROT LMTD/ DPP PORT Study Date of : PM , CSRU : PM CAROT LMTD/ DPP PORT Clip Reason: LEFT CAROT ONLY ( RIGHT SE DONE YESTERDAY Final Report CAROT SERIES COMPLETE. Duplex evaluation was performed of the left carotid artery. The right-side had been looked at another date. Significant heterogeneous plaque is noted, velocities are , , in the ICA, CCA, ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is .. This is consistent with less than % stenosis. However, diastolic velocities, especially in the common carotid artery are very limited, which may be consistent with more distal cervical carotid or intracranial carotid artery occlusive disease. IMPRESSION: Based on velocities, there is a less than % ICA stenosis at the bifurcation. However, diminished diastolic velocities raise concern of more distal stenosis or occlusion. Clinical correlation is warranted. EGD : Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus. Stomach: Contents: Scant melena was seen in the fundus. Duodenum: Normal duodenum. Other findings: Two large (.- cm necrotic ulcers were seen in the duodenal bulb. The more distal lesion was extending into the duodenal sweep which was difficult to traverse. Within the sweep, there was a large and semi-circumferential mass concerning for a malignancy. The lesion was ulcerated and oozing fresh blood from various points. There was no single lesion approporate to intervene on and biopsies were not taken because of active bleeding. After completing the procedure with the therapeutic scope, Dr. inserted the side-viewing scope for additional views. Thepulla was visualized and appeared unaffected.

MICU COURSE ( Septic shock: Serratia bacteremia seeded from L lower extremity wound as cultured at OSH. Blood cultures sent again at time of this admission, and had no growth. Septic shock resolved: off pressors for several days at OSH, here he was normotensive without pressors and good urine output. Creatinine was elevated but trended down to . at the time of discharge. Patient has been treated with ceftazidime and levofloxacin since for Serratia and other possible polymicrobial sources. Started on vancomycin at time of ICU admission, and continued hemodialysis begun at OSH. His antibiotic was eventually changed to strictly levaquin which continued thru . . Left lower extremity cellulitis: Extensive skin breakdown and impressive wet gangrene. On broad-spectrum antibiotics (as above with non-resolving infection. Podiatry and vascular surgery consult services evaluated his food. Vascular surgery performed emergent L leg guillotineputation and transfer to the CVICU. He then had a revision/closure of the BKA. . Dialysis fistula: Report of difficulty with dialysis via AV fistula at OSH. Had been off dialysis for > years until this recent hospitalization, so there was concern clot formation in old fistula but Renal transplant surgery evaluated and deemed it healthy with a good thrill, no stenosis, but anuresym possible. Pt had an ultrasound which showed patency. . Wegener's CKD s/p kidney transplant: Currently on Prograf, Imuran held during infection. Given creatinine bump at OSH (now trending down, underwent renal ultrasound to evaluate blood flow to graft, read pending. Prograf levels were checked daily. He was followed by the nephrology transplant team throughout this stay . Cardiology issues Patient complained of ongoing chest pain the morning after admission. Serial cardiac enzymes were checked, with CK-MB negative and troponin elevated to .. EKG within normal limits. Also underwent a TTE to evaluate degree of aortic stenosis; results appended. In brief, moderate-to-severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area . cm and mild (+ aortic regurgitation. He did not have any further chest pain or cardiac events during his admission . Respiratory distress: Was on nocturnal BiPAP at OSH, now with O saturation >% on supplemental oxygen. Started albuterol and atrovent. Noted skin breakdown on nose from OSH BiPAP. Weaned off without difficulty. . Nutrition: continuous tube feeds, eventually transitioned to liquid diet and then regular diet. At the time of discharge he is tolerating a regular diet. . Melena/Anemia: Pt was noted to have melanic stools after BKA. GI was consulted and performed an EGD. They found Blood in the fundus, Necrotic ulcers in the bulb and a large mass in the sweep concerning for malignancy with an otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum. He was placed on a ppi gtt and transfused as needed. A second EGD was done showing the second part of the duodenum had ulcerations, erythema, some mild bleeding, friability and granularity in a patchy distribution. This may represent resolving severe duodenal ulcer disease, however there remains a concern for possible mass lesion. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the second part of the duodenum. The biopsy ultimately came back negative for malignancy and showed active duodenitis with ulceration. He was continued on a PPI throughout his course and discharged on protonix mg . He will follow up for a repeat EGD in a month. Although there is no acute source of bleeding, he should have a hbg/hct checked twice per week.

Discharge Instructions: DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS FOLLOWING BELOW KNEE AMPUTATION This information is designed as a guideline to assist you in a speedy recovery from your surgery. Please follow these guidelines unless your physician has specifically instructed you otherwise. Please call our office nurse if you have any questions. Dial if you have any medical emergency. ACTIVITY: There are restrictions on activity. On the side of your amputation you are non weight bearing for - weeks. You should keep thisputation site elevated when ever possible. No driving until cleared by your Surgeon. PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS: Redness in or drainage from your leg wound(s. New pain, numbness or discoloration of your stump site. Watch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever greater than degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus draining from the incision site. If you experience any of these or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR. Exercise: You should work with physical therapy daily and work on improving strength. Limit strenuous activity for weeks. Do not drive a car unless cleared by your Surgeon. Try to keep leg elevated when able. BATHING/SHOWERING: You may shower. No bathing. A dressing may cover you??????re amputation site and this should be left in place for three ( days. Remove it after this time and wash your incision(s gently with soap and water. You will have sutures, which are usually removed in weeks. This will be done by the Surgeon on your follow-up appointment. WOUND CARE: When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision. These will stay on about a week and you may shower with them on. If these do not fall off after days, you may peel them off with warm water and soap in the shower. Avoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for four weeks after surgery. MEDICATIONS: Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the medications you were taking before surgery. You will be given a new prescription for pain medication, which can be taken every three ( to four ( hours only if necessary. Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet. (Check with your physician if you have fluid restrictions. If you feel that you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. You may use over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia. Appetite suppression may occur; this will improve with time. Eat small balanced meals throughout the day. CAUTIONS: NO SMOKING! Avoid pressure to yourputation site. No strenuous activity for weeks after surgery. DIET: There are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively. Poor appetite is expected for several weeks and small, frequent meals may be preferred. For people with vascular problems we would recommend a cholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and low in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile in your blood. Additionally, some people see a reduction in serum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol. Since a reduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that most people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to decrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the bad cholesterol. Exercise will increase your HDL (High Density Lipoprotein-the good cholesterol and with your doctor's permission, is typically recommended. You may be self-referred or get a referral from your doctor. If you are overweight, you need to think about starting a weight management program. Your health and its improvement depend on it. We know that making changes in your lifestyle will not be easy, and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new attitude. If interested you can may be self-referred or can get a referral from your doctor. If you have diabetes and would like additional guidance, you may request a referral from your doctor. FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT: Be sure to keep your medical appointments. The key to your improving health will be to keep a tight reign on any of the chronic medical conditions that you have. Things like high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol are major villains to the blood vessels. Don't let them go untreated! Please call the office on the first working day after your discharge from the hospital to schedule a follow-up visit. This should be scheduled on the calendar for seven to fourteen days after discharge. Normal office hours are :-: Monday through Friday.

180844.0,": : : Sex: F Service: Trauma HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs. is a year old female who was involved in a roll-over motor vehicle accident while on the interstate when she fell asleep at the wheel. The patient remembered all events and there was a question of loss of consciousness. The patient was taken to an outside hospital where she was found to be hemodynamically stable but a computerized tomography scan of the abdomen demonstrated a liver laceration. In addition, her hematocrit was found to have dropped from down to . At this point, the patient was transferred to for further workup. Upon arrival to the , the patient was hemodynamically stable with coma scale of . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She was alert and oriented with stable vital signs. He physical examination was unremarkable except for a bruise over her right anterior chest wall in addition to some tenderness. There was no crepitus. Her abdomen was soft, slightly distended and nontender. She had a right flank bruise with some ecchymosis, in addition left leg bruising just below the knee with no obvious fractures and palpable distal pulses. LABORATORY DATA: The patient's hematocrit upon arrival here was with coagulation screen demonstrating a PT of ., PTT and an INR of .. Her chem- was unremarkable. Her toxicology screen was negative. Her urine was clear. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient's trauma series was unremarkable. Her abdominal computerized tomography scan showed an L, L transverse process fracture in addition to the liver laceration, going through segment . It was a Grade laceration. In addition there was a smallount of fluid around the spleen. The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where she was monitored closely. The patient was transfused units of packed cells and units of fresh frozen plasma in order to correct coagulopathy. The patient was maintained on bedrest and had serial hematocrits checked. No surgery was consulted regarding the transverse process fracture and recommended bedrest in addition to leg roll precautions. By hospital day the patient's hematocrit was trending downward slowly and went from . and gradually went down to .. The patient was given Vitamin K for an INR of . and hematocrits were continued to be checked at this point. At this point it was decided not to transfuse this patient given she was hemodynamically stable. Of note, the patient also on hospital day became slightly confused at which point an arterial blood gases was checked in order to insure the patient was functioning well which she was. The patient was given some small dose Haldol in order to control her agitation. On hospital day the patient underwent a repeat computerized tomography scan which showed multiple rib fractures as well as liver laceration which was not progressive. Neurosurgery eventually signed off on the patient after they decided no intervention needs to be done for her spinal fracture. Over the subsequent days the patient continued to progress well and by the patient was transferred to the floor where she remained stable and will begin tolerating a regular diet. On , the patient was transfused unit of packed cells for a hematocrit of .. During the hospital course her platelets dropped from a high of down to . At that point heparin and Zantac were stopped and the patient was placed in Unna boots for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Since the transfer to the floor, the patient has been tolerating a regular diet and her blood pressure has been well controlled. In addition the patient has been alert and oriented. The patient now is waiting for discharge to rehabilitation. DISCHARGE STATUS: Stable. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: . Captopril mg p.o. t.i.d. . Lopressor mg p.o. b.i.d. . Tylenol to mg p.o. q. hours prn .

Anemia , E.M.D. : MEDQUIST D: : T: : : : : : Sex: F Service: TRAUMA SURGERY HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. is a -year-old woman who was driving her car on an interstate and supposedly fell asleep at the wheel. She was brought to the trauma bay at an outside after a rollover accident. She remembers all events subsequent to the accident. Work-up at an outside hospital demonstrated a liver laceration. Due to this liver laceration, Ms. was transferred to for further care. On arrival, she complained of back pain and chest pain. She had a GCS of . Of note, her hematocrit was noted to drop from to at an outside hospital. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Denies any past medical history. MEDICATIONS: Denies medications. ALLERGIES: Denies allergies. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Alert and oriented woman with a GCS of . Pupils were equal and reactive bilaterally at mm. There was a right periorbital bruise. The right eye movement was intact. Right eye acuity was intact. There was no tenderness over C-spine. Trachea was midline. There was poor inspiratory effort and there was a bruise over the right anterior chest wall. There was tenderness over the right anterior chest wall and there was no crepitus. The abdomen was obese, appeared slightly distended, however soft and nontender. There was a right flank bruise. The pelvis was stable and nontender. The back showed no step-offs, no tenderness or bruises. Extremities showed a left leg below-knee bruise and there was some tenderness over this bruise. The distal pulses were intact. Rectal exam had normal tone and was guaiac negative. LABORATORY STUDIES: White count on admission , white count on discharge ., hematocrit on admission , hematocrit on discharge ., platelet count , sodium , potassium ., chloride , bicarb , BUN , creatinine ., glucose . On discharge, AST , ALT , alk phos , total bili ., direct bili ., CKs less than , CK-MBs less than , magnesium ., ionized calcium .. RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES: Films at outside hospital: C-spine CT negative. TLS films negative. Abdominal CT at the outside hospital showed a liver laceration likely grade in segment . A very smallount of fluid around the spleen with an intact spleen. There was a transverse L-L process fracture, nondisplaced. ADDITIONAL STUDIES: Left tib/fib films showed no evidence of fracture. CT of L-spine showed transverse processes fracture at L, L, L and L levels. There was evidence of Paget's disease at L and L vertebral bodies. There was normal alignment of vertebral bodies. Portable chest was consistent with some pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis. CT of the abdomen repeated on showed several lacerations predominantly in the right hepatic lobe with no evidence of vascular injury or subcapsular hematoma. This was consistent with grade or injury given the number of lacerations. There was a splenic subcapsular hematoma with no laceration. There were some right-side rib fractures. Bilateral leg DVT studies were negative for DVT. CT of the head showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. C-spine and TLS films were negative for any evidence of fractures. CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE: Ms. was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit after her trauma resuscitation for observation of her liver lacerations. Her initial hospital course was significant for hypertension which required regulation with nitroglycerin. Subsequently, her medications were switched to captopril and Lopressor for further hypertension management. Her stay in the Intensive Care Unit was also prolonged secondary to change in mental status, difficulty to arouse. For this, she received a repeat head CT in this hospital which was negative for any hemorrhages. She received an epidural for pain control for possible rib fractures which on CT scan were determined to be right-sided rib fractures. This epidural was removed since it was not functioning and eventually after all pain medications were withdrawn, she slowly improved in her mental status to baseline of alert and oriented . Ms. was also seen by neurosurgery and was cleared forbulation after her L-spine showed nondisplaced fractures at L, L, L and L levels. On discharge, Ms. was neurologically alert and oriented. She had a stable controlled blood pressure on Lopressor and captopril. She was able to do incentive spirometry. She was tolerating a regular diet. She was voiding spontaneously. She wasbulate on the floor. She is being discharged to rehabilitation for improving her strength.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a M with history of ESRD, COPD, CAD, CVA transferred from an outside hospital with bilateral pleural effusions and right loculated hemopneumothorax. Question of perforated G-tube: On admission to the , a G-tube check indicated proper placement of the G-tube with no extravasation of contrast, indicating that a perforation was not present. Repeat CT indicated no free air in the abdomen. Hemopneumothorax: A CXR for PICC placement on admission showed worsening hemopneumothorax. CT scan showed large right hydropneumothorax, which is predominantly loculated posteriorly, with smaller anterior component with layering fluid. Right lung was mostly collapsed, except for a small portion of the right upper lobe. There was also moderate left pleural effusion, with related compressive atelectasis. Large, round perihilar lymph nodes were also noted. IP and thoracics were consulted the patient had chest tubes placed on HD: left, right anterior, and right posterior. The chest tubes drained serosanguinous fluid that was exudative by Light's criteria. No malignant cells were noted on cytology. On HD, the patient received a bronchoscopy that ruled out endotrachial tumors and cleared secretions. Two chest tubes were taken out on HD and HD, but the left posterior tube was left in place. Repeat chest CTA on HD showed the size of right hemopneumothorax had decreased, but was still loculated, the L lung had re-expanded, although there was still a persistent apical pneumothorax. Patient was further evaluated by thoracic surgery and interventional pulmonology, and both teams decided that chest tubes would be of no further benefit to the patient. A surgical operation would be necessary to re-expand the patient's right lung, but the patient was not a surgical candidate due to his multiple co-morbidities. On HD, the last chest tube was also taken out. On HD, patient received another therapeutic bronchoscopy that was only signficant for secretions. Pneumonia: The patient developed a pseudomonas pneumonia on HD and was initially treated with Zosyn. The pseudomonas was eventually found to be pan-sensitive and the patient was started on Ceftazidime g qHD, which is the dose for ESRD on HD. He was continued on this regimen until discharge. He will receive one more dose of Ceftazidime at HD after discharge, after which he will have completed a day course. Mental status: The patient was alert and oriented upon transfer to the . However, his mental status began to wax and wane. On HD, he became somnolent, but was still arousable. His mental status deteriorated over the next day, and on HD, when his white blood cell count climbed to ., he became difficult to arouse. He triggered for tachypnea and nursing concern for somnolence. Head CT was negative for bleed/ischemia. He was transferred to the MICU with a blood gas of .//. In the MICU, CTA was negative for PE. Lumbar puncture showed no PMN or micro-organisms on gram stain and no growth was noted on culture. His respiratory culture speciated while in the MICU, and he began Ceftazidime for pseudomonas pneumonia at this time. HD, his oxygenation had improved and his WBC count had decreased to ., and the patient was transferred back to floor. On the floor, his mental status continued to improve with intermittent periods of somnolence. On the day of discharge, his mental status was back to his baseline. He was alert and oriented (aware of his name, that he was at , and that it was . Diarrhea/Rectal Bleeding: On HD, the patient developed loose stools and diarrhea and a rectal tube was inserted. Bloody diarrhea was then noticed in the rectal tube, and it was discontinued. The patient was started on PO vancomycin to cover for C. diff. He was found to be C. diff negative , and stool culture, ova and parasite were negative as well. PO vancomycin was discontinued. On HD, the day of discharge, the patient's abdominal pain and distension had resolved, and he was no longer having diarrhea. DMII: The patient's DMII was managed with a Humalog sliding scale. He was also started back on Lantus, which he was on at home. At time of discharge, the patient was receiving U of Lantus at noon as well as the sliding scale. ESRD: He received dialysis every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and also received Epo and antibiotics at HD.

Brief Hospital Course: y.o male with past hx of CABGx years ago complicated by left hemothorax, CHF with systolic and diastolic dysfunction, afib, and hx of melena here with complaint of shortness of breath and falls. . CAD - The patient underwent a staged catherization during which he had angioplasty of his left circumflex and subsequent placement of a bare metal stent to his RCA. The patient was started on aspirin and plavix. He also received hours of integrelin post-stent. Plavix was continued for weeks from the day of stnet placement. Due to GI bleed and per cardiology, ASA was held. Several weeks post PCI placement, ASA and plavis were resumed after stability of hematocrit was assured. . ACUTE EXACERBATION OF CHRONIC HEART FAILURE - The patient was found to still be in some degree of congestive heart failure given his elevated JVP and crackles on exam. Given his aortic stenosis, he was diuresed initially with lasix and then mg PO lasix . He was then intubated prior to endoscopy while in the MICU given his tenous cardiopulmonary status. He received a total of units pRBCs and was significantly volume overloaded. Diuresis was hld due to renal failure and hypotension. Due to significant pulmonary edema contributing to respiratory failure, Lasix was started. . GI bleed - The patient had one episode of BRBPR just prior to his first intervention, however his hematocrit was stable. He had one further episode post catherization and his crit dropped from ~ to . on . He was transfused one unit of blood, however, his crit dropped further to the day after and he was transferred to the unit. The nadir of his Hct was . He was transfused a total of units PRBC, units FFP, bags of platelets on (the day of his transfer. He underwent endoscopy, which was normal. He had a tagged bleeding scan, which was positive in the splenic flexure. He then underwent embolization of the branches by angio. He had one further episode of maroon stools, and was transfused one unit prophylactically. His hematocrit remained stable and he required no further transfusion. . Thrombocytopenia - It was noted that the patient had an acute drop in his platelet count from admission of >%. The patient had documented exposure to heparin on , and therefore suspicion for heparin induced thrombocytopenia was high. Heparin dependent antibodies returned positive, however, f/u test were negative. Given the timing and resoution of his thrombocytopenia, integrelin induced thrombocytopenia was suspected. . Respiratory failure - Pt as determined to be in respiratory failure due to volume overload to fluid resucitation. He was diuresed aggressivly which improved pulmonary status and improved ventilator requirements. Extubation was attempted however he developed a collpase of his lung due to mucus plugging. He underwent bronchoscopy, became hypoxic and was reintubated. He again underwent agressive diuresis, pt self extubated became hypoxic and again required extubation. Finally, he was extubated as ventilator was weaned and he sustained a SBT for hrs. He again became acutely dyspneic, most likely due to generalized myopathy. He became distressed but refused reintuation. He was made comfort measures only, started on a morphine drip to reduce air hunger, and passed away several hours later. . Myopathy - Unclear why, but pt appeared to have significant difficulty with respiratory effort despite prolonged breathing trials with which he was successful.

IMAGING: Chest-ray performed on admission demonstrated a globular appearing cardiac silhouette with small bilateral effusions and an overall picture concerning for pericardial effusion. HOSPITAL COURSE: After the patient was transferred to the on a pericardial drain was placed to treated the pericardial effusion. This drained approximately liter in the immediate period and she therefore underwent a pericardial window procedure on for persistent fluid reaccumulation. The patient tolerated this procedure well and was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit postoperatively for close observation. She was extubated on postoperative day one with two chest tubes in place and was transferred to the floor on postoperative day two in stable condition. The patient did well, but developed a temperature spike on postoperative day six along with increased shortness of breath. A chest-ray at this time demonstrated hydropneumothorax. This was treated without intervention and subsequently resolved. The patient did have another temperature spike to . and was subsequently found to have MRSA bacteremia. This was treated with intravenous Vancomycin. A transesophageal echocardiogram was done to evaluate the heart valve given the recent procedure and persistent bacteremia. This finding was consistent with endocarditis. The infectious disease team was therefore consulted for management. Per their recommendations, the patient was treated with Levofloxacin for gram negative coverage along with Vancomycin for MRSA bacteremia and presumed endocarditis. She was also on Valcyte for a positive CMV antibody titer. Around this time the patient developed severe right hip pain permitting her frombulating. An MRI was performed, which was negative for infection, but did show mild degenerative joint disease. The patient was focally tender over the greater trochanter area and an orthopedic consultation was therefore obtained for possible trochanteric bursitis. Per their recommendations given that the patient was already on steroids they felt that it would be unuseful to treat her with additional steroid medications as it might potentiate her dependence on steroids. The patient was therefore treated with aggressive physical therapy and was seen by the acute pain service. An MRI was obtained to rule out radiculopathy, which was negative. She was treated with Tylenol with Percocet for breakthrough pain and is scheduled to see the pain service as an outpatient. During her hospitalization, a biopsy of the transplant kidney was performed, which was negative for rejection.

She was last admitted to this hospital for her th cycle of cisplatin. She was given /taxol once in , and was changed to -cytoxan for low counts in /. She tne received six cycles of cisplatin started in and administered in the hospital because of the questionable history of allergic reaction to carboplatin. - Since that admission, she showed signs of fluid retention, both in her legs and in her ascites but she did not have any evidence of congestive heart failure based on exam with normal lungs and flat JVD. There was concern that perhaps her cancer was progressing and that is the reason for her tense ascites, but consideration was also given to worsening renal failure as explanation for increased ascites. CT scan taken showed increased ascites, but otherwise stable exam with mesenteric masses and evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis that appear unchanged when compared to . - Her husband reported some recent confusion during their clinic visit on . Due to her creatinine clearance of about mL/min, the decision was made during this visit to switch the patient to weekly gemzar despite the stability of dz achieved withcisplatin. Due to her decreased creatinine clearance, a reduced dose of mg per meters squared was chosen. She was started on this dose on and acutely tolerated it well. The plan was for weekly gemzar, three weeks on and one week off. - The patient first felt different from her normal self on Saturday, when she ""started to feel lousy."" She saw an accupuncturist on Sat. for posterior neck pain; needles were inserted into her head, back and ankles. On Sunday, her weakness progressed to the point that she could no longer stand. Her husband noted a bloodshot left eye ealier today, now resolved. She recently fell on her left buttock. - On ROS, the patient notes moderate to severe abdominal pain for the past several days, especially before meals and sometimes resolved with food. She sleeps with three pillows. - Today, the patient's fellow contact her. She reported the above symptoms and was told to come to clinic. Her hematocrit has decreased from to and so she was admitted to omed and immediately transferred to ICU as INR>. ON TRANSFER BACK TO OMED FROM ICU: Mrs. is a y/o F with recurrent ovarian CA, s/p CABG, s/p MV repair, and hypothyroid, presented from onc clinic on with weakness, nausea, and decreased PO intake since gemcitabine tx on and on clinic visit was found to be hyptotensive, decrease hct (from . to ., and INR>. Patient was initially admitted to OMED service, but transferred to MICU for further evaluation. Please see MICU Admit note for more information on past medical hx and course during stay. In brief, patient was admitted for hemodynamic stability and work up of coagulopathic state. Mrs. denied diarrhea, hematuria but did report very slight BRBPR on toilet paper. She was trace guiac positive on admission. She had diffuse ecchymosis over lower extremities, back, and buttocks. She received units of PRBC's with appropriate bump in hct to . on . In terms of her coagulopathy, it is thought that a combination of coumadin (for h/o DVT, decrease PO intake, and recent administration of gemcitabine were instigating factors. Coumadin held on admission. She received unit FFP and was initially treated with PO vitamin K while in MICU, with decrease in INR to . on morning of . On she received mg vitamin K. Her initial mixing studies were negative for inhibitors. Shortly after receiving the units of blood, patient became SOB secondary to fluid overloaded state. She was diuresed and responded well to lasix; however, creatinine began rising (above baseline of ~. likely because of hypovolumia and decrease blood flow to kidneys. Patient was subsequently gently hydrated, with impoved renal status. Creatinine . on . During fluid overloaded state, Mrs. also developed AFib, which per family was new onset. After cardiology consult and discussion with primary oncology team, it was decided to cardiovert patient. She tolerated well and is now in NSR.

Gallbladder/liver U/S: IMPRESSION: . Mixed hyper- and hypoechoic lesion at the borders of segment VII andII, corresponding to the approximately cm lesion noted on CT, which displays more CT features of a hemangioma. The other presumed probable flash-filling cavernous hemangioma within segment could not be identified son despite extensive scanning through this region in multiple positions and is likely isoechoic to the surrounding parenchyma. Again, CT features are most suggestive of hemangiomas and lesion would be highly atypical for rectal metastases. If further confirmation is needed, a dedicated MRI would be the best examination (patient may benefit from being scanned on large bore magnet on due to claustrophobia. Alternatively multiphasic CT could also be performed (less desirable given multiple prior CT's or this could be followed on subsequent imaging. .

Brief Hospital Course: yo F with newly diagnosed rectal adenocarcinoma with lower extremity weakness and intitial concern for cord compression which was ruled out and determined to be related to lumbosacral compression from tumor burden. She was started on chemo/radiation therapy and transferred to to complete her treatment . Hypotension: On arrival to the hospital, patient was normotensive, in the emergency department, she was given valium and fentanly for sedation prior to MRI and became hypotensive to /, she was bolused L NS in the ED and admitted to the MICU. However, by the time she arrived in the ICU SBP s and MAP > . Patient was mentating with good urine output. Hypotension is of unclear etiology likely hypovolemia versus medication side effect (occured following valium and fentanyl. No evidence of infection to suggest septic shock. No evidence of decompensated heart failure on exam or by history. No increased O requirement to suggest massive PE or chest pain to suggest ACS. Pt denied being on BP meds. Her pressures remained within the 's to 's during the first few days and then the day prior to admission, the patient was hypertensive with SBP in the - range. She was transferred to the oncology service for work up of lower extremity weakness. She was discharged OFF her home Metoprolol, which was not restarted. . Lower extremity weakness and numbness: On admission there was concern that this could represent cord compression or cauda equina syndrome. Originally reported urinary retention but on further history actually did not want to use a bed pan and preferred a foley. MRI of the T- and L-spine were done and was not complete due to patient's anxiety but were reviewed by radiology and neurology and neurosurgery and felt to be sufficient to rule out cord compression. Patient also examined by Neurology and Neurosourgery and exam was not consistent with cord compression or cauda equina. Neurology and radiology felt symptoms due to lumbosacral plexus invasion of tumor. No further imaging was done as the patient was claustrophobic and does not tolerate sedating medications well. Her Foley was discontinued when she arrived to the floor and was urinating without issues. She was also seen by colorectal surgery, radiation oncology and medical oncology. There was some initial concern that there was metastasis in the liver, but after further review, it was decided that they were more likely hemangiomas. Her case was discussed during GI rounds and it was decided to start neo-adjuvant chemo/radiation therapy. FU and radiation therapy was started , the plan is for her to continue radiation for treatments and -Fluorouracil for weeks however duration of therapy will be guided by outpatient oncologist.

197195.0,": : : Sex: M Service: MEDICINE Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions : Chief Complaint: Unresponsiveness Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation at outside hospital Mechanical ventilation Extubation History of Present Illness: year old male without any known medical problems but with possible depression/anxiety/bipolar disease who was called out from the ICU today after an extubation for violent and agitated behavior. He was involved in a violent altercation with his father two evenings ago, fueled a likely overdose of dextrmethorphan combined with alcohol. Per report, he had nearly strangled his father to unconsciousness, who required stitches and now filed a restraining order. The police arrived at the scene, and were unable to subdue the patient with multiple taser shocks (- times. He remained uncooperative. He was eventually brought to LGH, though had apparently some respiratory distress en route. Alcohol and marijuana were detected in the . He was so agitated that he apparently required propofol/vecuronium sedation and was intubated. He was transferred to thereafter. In the ED, initial VS . / % unknown vent settings. He was found to have an abrasion over his left hand which was irrigated, and receivedp/sulbactam. He was then admitted to the MICU for further management. In the MICU, he continued unasyn overnight and was extubated the following day. He was continued on CIWA due to an elevated ETOH level but he did not require additional benzos. A transition to PO augmentin yesterday was short-lived, as he spiked fevers to last evening, . this morning. He was seen by hand surgery, who splinted the hand and recommended continued unasyn. Psychiatry and social work are both following. A warrant exists in for his arrest, and police will be providing a : sitter shortly. He has a long history of violent behavior, which prompted his ""other than honorable discharge"" from the marines several years ago. Per his mother, he tends to get violent when under the influence of drugs. Currently, he has a dry cough which has been present for about hours. He denies shortness of breath. He denies malaise, fatigue, weakness, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, hematuria, loose stools. Past Medical History: - ADHD, not on meds - possible depression/anxiety - two psychiatric hospitalizations at in from to and in from to//.

Prominent/modestly peaked T waves are non-specific and may be within normal limits. Cannot exclude possible hyperkalemia. Clinical correlation is suggested.

IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis was much more pronounced on CT torso two hours earlier. LEFT HAND, EWS : No specific localizing history is available. Allowing for this, no fracture or dislocation is detected about the left hand. No focal lytic or sclerotic lesion is identified. There is soft tissue swelling along the dorsum of the hand. No radiopaque foreign body or subcutaneous emphysema is detected. Brief Hospital Course: Mr. is a year old male with a nonspecific history of depression/anxiety/violence, polysubstance abuse, who was involved in a violent altercation requiring significant sedation and eventual intubation at an outside institution, who was transferred to for further management of mechanical respiration and a left hand infected bite wound. ACTIVE PROBLEMS: . MECHANICAL VENTILATION: He was intubated at an OSH for agitation. CXR was clear without evidence of gas exchange impairment. Patient extubated without difficulty. SW and Psych evaluated the patient while in the ICU, with recommenadtion for prn haldol, ativan, and benadryl for further agitation. . AGITATION/VIOLENCE: Social work and psychiatry teams were immediately consulted for further management of his agitation. His mother revealed a dextromethorphan overdose pattern which causes euphoria and agitation, and the patient later confirmed this fact. Psych initially recommended benadryl/haldol/ativan for sedation, though was calm upon extubation and required no further chemical sedation. He did not physically or verbally abuse staff members. Psychiatry followed him throughout the hospitalization. Per psych attending discharge recommendations: Patient's history is suggestive of antisocial personality disorder, although there are some inconsistencies in the reported historical data (compare information from c info patient later reported to Dr. , so it is difficult to say c certainy how accurate this diagnosis is. I don't appreciate persuasive evidence for a major mood or anxiety disorder, although patient does have some situational anxiety. At present, there is no psychiatric contraindication to patient's return to the legal system. Based on current data, I do not see an indication for a placement in a forensic psychiatric setting for acute risk; however, appreciating that risk assessment is dynamic, depending on the specific charges that patient is facing (e.g., level of severity, which we do not know at this time, his risk for impulsive self-harm might escalate in proportion to subjective sense of desperation & anxiety that is independent of a major mental illness. Patient is able to voice a clear understanding regarding his immediate future plans and an apparent acceptance of the situation. We rev'd how to access care within the justice system. . LEFT HAND BITE WOUND: He sustained a left th MCP fight bite which subsequently became infected. He developed fevers to in the ICU with tachycardia. Received fluids and intravenous unasyn. The hand surgery team was consulted and cleaned the wound and splinted it. Swelling was intitially substantial, but improved with elevation in stockignette. He required no operative debridement. He continued hours of intravenous unasyn and was discharged to complete additional days of PO augmentin. He will follow up with the hand team in one week, at which point he will likely have an extensor tendon repair, which was partially torn in the fight. Will need daily dressing changes. Elevation no longer necessary. Tylenol and ibuprofen for pain. . ELECTRICAL INJURY: Patient received multiple electrical shocks from Taser, putting him at risk for arrythmia, rhabdomyolysis, and burns. CK stable without evidence of rhabdomylolysis. . POLYSUBSTANCE ABUSE: Patient with EtOH level of at OSH with report of history of polysubstance abuse, particularly the dextromethorphan that triggered his acute agitation. Hyperstimulation and disassociation likely in setting of dextromethorphan. PCP and ketamine labs were pending at the time of discharge. . LEGAL: A warrant was issued for his arrest.

Pericardial fluid was sent for cytology, fluid culture, (including fungal, anaerobic, and acid fast cx and microscopic analysis (gram stain and acid fast stain. A pericardial drain was left in place. There was no tamponade physiology demonstrated before or during the procedure. The patient was transferred to the CCU. In the immediate post-procedure period, the patient complained of mild, nonradiating chest pain localized over his sternum, but EKG showed no ischemic changes and the pain responded to low dose morphine. This mild chest pain decreased over the period of the hospital course and was considered to be pericarditic in origin. A pericardial rub was heard directly after the procedure. The pericardial drain had decreasing output after the procedure; hour post-procedure drain output totaled cc and the following hours totaled cc. On , tranthoracic echocardiogram revealed no residual effusion and normal RV size. The pericardial drain was therefore removed after instilling cc of % lidocaine into the drain for local pain relief. A wound dressing was placed over the previous site of the drain. On , the patient continued his recovery, with no SOB or oter cardiac symptoms. The wound dressing was changed after the first had sersanginous drainage; the second dressing showed minimal drainage. THe pericardial rub was not present on physical examination on . Repeat echcardiogram on again revealed no pericardial effusion. Results of pericardial fluid analysis available during the hospital course suggested a viral vs. idiopathic etiology for the pericardial effusion. Pericardial fluid chemistries showed the pericardial fluid to be transudative (LDH, Tot Pro low. Cytology was negative for malignant cells.

This went well and the patient did fine overnight. The following day, the patient had a loop cystectomy by Dr. . The procedure went fine, however when the patient was extubated he desaturated and had to be reintubated. He was then transferred to the intensive care unit. He was started on a Versed drip. He was kept on CMV. The epidural catheter from hissurgery was left in place. He did not require any pressors and, although he became hypotensive, his blood pressure was maintained overnight with fluid boluses. A nasogastric tube was placed and left to suction. He was making adequate urine from his stoma. He was started on Ancef and Gentamycin empirically. On postoperative day one, the Neurology servie saw the patient because he had a positivve acetylcholine receptor antibiody test. The felt that the patient's clinical picture was more consistent with multiple systems atrophy (MSAhowever. A repeat antibody test was sent and the patient was scheduled for an EMG for further evaluation of the possibility that he may have in addition to MSA. He was weaned off of the Versed drip. He spiked a fever of . in the afternoon, which was thought to be due to atelectasis. A chest-ray was sent which showed right upper lobe consolidation versus atelectasis. The patient self-extubated later that day and did well on four liters of oxygen via the nasal canula. His epidural catheter was held and his pain was controlled with intravenour pain medication. He was left NPO with an NG tube. His electrolytes and blood count were normal. On postoperative day two, his epidural catheter was removed by the pain service. Thr patient required racemic epinepherine every four hours all night for shortness of breath. His Ancef was discontinued and Ceftriaxone was begun for possible pneumonia vs fluid overloaded. He was afebrile all day and his white blood cell count was . On postoperative day three, his NG tube was removed. His Gentamycin was stopped. He continued to make adequate urine. His was hep-locked. He did very well from a respiratory standpoint. He no longer required racemic epinepherine. His lungs and breath sounds improved gradually over the course of the day. Some of his difficulty with respiration was thought to be due to his baseline neurologic status combined with narcotic pain medication. This improved on tylenol. Physical therapy saw and evaluated the patient and got him out of bed. On postoperative day four, the patient was transferred to the floor early in the morning. He was started on sips of clears and this was advanced when he passed gas and had a bowel movement. He was gently diuresed and weaned off oxygen. JP was d/c'd on POD.

Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. was a same day admit and on was brought directly to the operating room where she underwent an aortic valve replacement. Please see operative note for surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day one she was started on beta-blockers and diuretics and diuresed towards her pre-op weight. On post-op day two she was transferred to the step-down floor for further care. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. On post-op day three she had an episode of atrial fibrillation which converted to sinus rhythm with beta-blockers and Amiodarone. She was started on coumadin for her afib. she was agressively diuresed toward her pre-op weight. She experienced post-op confusion and all narcotics were discontinued and her mental status claered. The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and mobilityd rehab was recommended. By the time of discharge on POD the patient wasbulating with assist, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. The patient was discharged to rehab in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.

Ms. was admitted to this hospital from to with altered mental status. She was diagnosed with multiple subacute cerebrovascular infarcts likely secondary to cardioembolic phenomenon. She was noted to have low blood pressures during that hospitaliztion ranging from the s to s systolic. She also was noted to have a persistent oxygen requirement of liters initially attributed to cardiogenic pulmonary edema although hypoxia persisted despite diuresis. She was discharged to skilled nursing facility on but her rehabilitation was complicated by two hospital admissions for pneumonia and congetive heart failure (not at this facility. She was ultimately discharged home two weeks ago. Since being home she has been noted to be weaker than her recent baseline. She has beenbulating in her house without a walker and in general performing all of her activities of daily living. She continues to have waxing and mental status, particularly when she is not feeling well. Per her niece over the past week she has been experiencing cough productive of minimal sputum, sore throat, clear rinorrhea. Her niece has also experienced similar symptoms. She has not been experiencing frank fevers or chills. She has been weaker than baseline. She has not had lightheadedness or dizziness. She has been using L nasal canula at home and this has not changed. She has complained of mild shortness of breath with exertion but this is unchanged for the past month. No chest pain or shortness of breath. No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria. She has had intermittent leg swelling but no leg pain. She has bilateral tremor at rest. All other review of systems is negative in detail. On the day of presentation she was noted to have low grade fevers with intermittent episodes of heavy coughing with a choking sensation. On one occassion she brought up a small amount of pink material which is what prompted her niece to bring her to the emergency room. . In the ED, initial vs were: T: . BP: / HR: R: O sat % on L. Her blood pressures ranted from the low s to s systolic with heart rate in the s. She initially required increased supplemental oxygen of L but primarily was satting in the mid s on L nasal canula. She received L normal saline was persistently hypotensive and had a right IJ placed and was started on levophed. She received aspirin mg PO. she received vancomycin gram, ceftriaxone gram, levofloxacin mg , aziathromycin mg and combivent nebulizers. Labs were notable for a WBC count of . with % neutrophils and acute renal failure with a creatinine of . from baseline of .. Lactate was normal at .. She had one set of negative cardiac enzymes and an EKG which showed atrial fibrillation without ischemic changes. She had a CXR which showed mild pulmonary edema and a CTA which was negative for pulmonary embolism and also showed mild pulmonary edema. She was admitted to the MICU for further management. . On arrival to the MICU she is alert but confused and very talkative. She denies pain, fevers, lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain. She does endorse cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat.

Brief Hospital Course: year old female with a past medical history of occipital stroke with memory difficulties and atrial fibrillation who presented from home with cough for one week found in the emergency room to be hypotensive requiring pressor support from c diff colitis. septic shock: Patient was hypotensive on admission fitting a SIRS/sepsis picture and initially required vasopressors to maintain MAPs>. She was weaned off the pressor and found to be C. diff positive. She received days of azithromycin to cover for possible atypical pneumonia given ground glass opacities seen on CTA. Influenza screen was negative. Blood cultures have been negative to date. Pt was treated with PO vancomycin and received / days of antibiotics. C. dfff colitis: She is being treated with po vancomycin with plans for a day course. hypoxemia: Patient has liter oxygen requirement at home without clear history of lung disease. She had flash pulmonary edema on night of admission in setting of sinus tachycardia and fluid resuscitation for sepsis. She has been treated with lasix diuresis and originally BIPAP then high flow mask. A cardiogenic cause related to worsening valvular disease was considered but ruled out with basically unchanged Echo. Her respiratory exam improved with lasix diuresis, and she was in the low to mid 's on room air, but still required oxygen whenbulating. She will be discharged on lasix mg PO daily and potassium supplementation Acute Renal Failure: Patient had acute renal failure on admission which was likely prerenal in the setting of what appeared to be septic shock with low UOP. ATN still remains in differential. She was diuresed with lasix drip despite renal failure to treat pulmonary edema and improve lung function. While on the drip, her creatinine improved and trended back towards her baseline. Cr was . at transfer (baseline .-.. Anemia, NOS: Known iron deficiency anemia with baseline hematocrit . No active sites of bleeding. Guaiac negative. She received units of pRBCs to improve hypotension and anemia. A daily iron supplement was continued, but last set of iron studies suggest her iron levels are much improved. She was continued on iron supplementation, but can consider d/c by her PMD if she finds her pill burden too great at home. delerium, NOS: Patient with waxing and mental status at home that worsened significantly while in house. Current exam consistent for delirium with primary aspect of disorientation with non-focal neurologic exam. Patient with known occipital infarctions thought to be secondary to cardioembolic phenomenon. Her home zyprexa and sertraline were continued. She was discharged on zyprexa. Atrial Fibrillation: Rhythm currently in atrial fibrillation, controlled on oral diltiazem. No chest pain or shortness of breath. Her home digoxin was held in the setting of renal failure. Patient and family decided not to anticoagulate given bleeding risks. She was changed from digoxin/metoprolol to a once daily diltiazem dose which maintained an excellent HR, even withbulation. Diastolic Heart Failure, acute, decompensated: Patient diagnosed with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure during recent hospitalization although her response to diuretics was unclear and she does not have a history of hypotension. Echocardiogram with preserved ejection fraction. An attempt was made to dry her out enough to minimize her O requirement, but she was never able tobulate without requiring O so she was again discharged with home O, only now withbulation only. Cerebrovascular Disease: s/p occipital stroke in thought to be secondary to cardioembolic disease. She was started on full dose aspirin, and her home plavix and high dose statin were continued. Follow up with neurology was requested. FEN: Due to altered mental status, we obtained bedside swallow evaluation. They cleared her by bedside eval but could no r/o silent aspiration witho video. We elected to defer this evaluation given her goals of care and quality of life to not limit thin liquids, but instead to discharge her with aspiration precautions. Nutrition had also recommended tube feeds if there was not adequate intake, but the patient was eating well by the time of discharge and tube feeds were not felt to be needed at that time. : DNR/DNI (discussed with HCP/niece Communication: Patient, niece Medications on Admission: Medications on admission : Bumetanide mg Plavix mg daily Digoxin mcg Metoprolol Tartrate mg PO B Olanzapine . mg QHS Potassium mEq PO daily Sertraline mg daily Simvastatin mg PO daily Acetaminophen PO T:PRN Ferrous Sulfate mg PO T Multivitamin Discharge Medications: .
