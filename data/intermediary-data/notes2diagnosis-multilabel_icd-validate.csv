Pt's family states that pt was in usual state of health until days prior to admission when she got a flu shot at her PCP's office. Since that time, she has been weak, fatigued with fevers/chills, nausea and vomiting. She states that she was using her inhaler for shortness of breath and wheezing but it wasn't helping. son took her out to dinner on the night prior to admission and notes that she looked well. She ate a good dinner but afterwards, her son reports that she was more wheezy than her baseline. He got concerned today when she did not show up at her hair appointment. He went to her home and found her sitting up in her chair, nauseous, weak and wheezing. She had not yet taken her medications yet for the day. She was also complaining of RUQ abdominal pain and short of breath. He then took her to the ER. . At baseline, pt has a chronic cough productive of white sputum which has not recently changed in color or frequency. She is fully functional, lives alone, performs all of her ADLs, walks without a walker. Her only residual deficit from her stroke is right hand weakness and some word finding difficulties. At baseline, she can only walk up - steps before getting short of breath. She has no recent travel, no sick contacts though her son recently had a cold. She coughs occasionally when she eats and depending on what she is eating. She sleeps on one big pillow at home and this has not changed. No recent medication changes, no increase in her weight, no change in her diet. She denies any diarrhea. . In ED, she was found to have a temp of and O sat of % on RA. She pt received ceftriaxone/azithro and flagyl for presumed PNA. Pt was then noted to cough up a largeount of blood streaked sputum though the next sputum was clear of blood. Given concern for PE a CTA was ordered but pt was hydrated with L of NS over hours prior to the study due to her cr of .. After the fluid bolus, pt became more hypoxic requiring a NRB and then BiPAP which she did not tolerate. She received mg of IV lasix to which she responded poorly to and she was started on a nitro drip for hypertension to the s. She continued to have increased work of breathing with a RR of and she asked to be intubated. On the propofol, she dropped her pressure to the s and she was given Narcan mg .

The patient was in fact extubated briefly, but required re-intubation in setting of respiratory distress and a question of septic physiology. She continued on antibiotics, and began treatmen for sepsis when swan numbers showed evidence for this. She alternated between septic and cardiogenic physiology and she continued to get more and more volume overloaded. Attempts to diurese were met with hypotension and low urine output. Agitation was frequently an issue resulting in respiratory discomfort and hypertension. Plans for a trach and peg were made with surgery. However, after a lengthy discussion with family, PCP, patient, it was decided that patient did not want to continue aggressive medical care.

CT of the brain without contrast noted two or three bullet tracks; the first one was noted in the right temporal region causing fracture to the right superior orbital rim with displaced ramus. Also noted was a moderate sized subdural collection extending to the inferior right temporal region, as well as an intraparenchymal hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage noted per bullet track. Bullet fragments were also seen in the right orbital region and exiting toward the anterior ethmoid and left frontal region with the fragments also passing from the right sphenoid ridge to the right temporal and frontal regions, obliquely. Also noted was a bullet track originating posteriorly through the occipital bone traversing to the left cerebellar region and terminating posterior to the petrous bone. The midline was displaced approximately mm to the left ................... to the level of the fornix. Also seen was air-fluid levels in the bilateral maxillary, sinus sphenoid and ethmoidal sinuses. Finally there was mild displacement of the fourth ventricle. CT, noncontrast, scans of the neck showed no cervical spine fractures, with a left submandibular hematoma and extensive soft tissue bleeding. There were metallic foreign bodies in the left submandibular space. Also noted was a soft tissue disruption along the bullet track adjacent to the left submandibular space extending into the subcutaneous soft tissues. Also noted was deep soft tissue air through the lower neck soft tissues, along with mild swelling of the lower aspect of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle, as well as the superior mediastinum. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was prepped, and an ICP monitor was placed. The patient had an initial ICP of -, but subsequently after five minutes, ICP was noted to be -. Intravenous Mannitol was initially started but then stopped subsequent to decreased systolic blood pressure. The patient was given intravenous lactate Ringer' to maximize pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of -. The patient was also started on Oxacillin while ICP drains were in place. The patient was transfused ultimately U packed red blood cells, FFP and platelets to maintain hematocrit and correct coagulopathy.

Sodium and osmoles trended up to Na> on mannitol (which had been held and vasopressin drip was started. On , a repeat CT showed diffuse cerebral edema, herniation, and strokes in the PCA territory as well as hemorrhage. Her pupils remained fixed and dilated, and she had limited brainstem reflexes. Blood pressure dropped and she eventually required high doses of two pressors. A family discussion was held, and new information about a possible medical history of malignancy was mentioned. The family felt that recently she had been doing many things ""as if preparing for death,"" such as visiting the cemetery, seeing many family members, and even traveling to to visit family. She had also lost a lot of weight recently, had been quite fatigued, and had been injecting herself with a mysterious medication that she told family members was insulin. The family felt that she should be made comfortable at the end of her life, given the poor prognosis, and considering a possible underlying process. She was extubated and was pronounced dead at on . She did not breathe on her own after extubation. The family requested an autopsy. They declined donation.

Bronchoscopy History of Present Illness: The patient is a -year-old woman with a past medical history significant for resection of her thyroid at age and abdominal hysterectomy three years ago. For both of these, she required general endotracheal anesthesia. She was in her usual state of health until the spring of when she passed out from unknown causes and required intubation for days. An extensive work-up was unrevealing. About weeks post discharge she developed a harsh progressive cough. This progressed to dyspnea and stridor and was evaluated by ear, nose, and throat specialist. She was found to have subglottic granulation tissue and underwent resection of this. Postoperatively, she developed respiratory distress and required intubation. She was subsequently found to have tracheal stenosis and underwent placement of a tracheostomy. At that time, a CT scan demonstrated -mm long area of stenosis extending from the cervical trachea down to the arch of the aorta. She was treated with ablative therapy, which included cryotherapy and laser therapy. Ultimately, a silicone Dumon stent was placed and maintained for months. Ultimately, it was removed on , and she subsequently developed recurrent stenosis. She was evaluated by you at this point and ultimately had a temporary silicone stent replaced. She now presents for surgical consideration. Other than the two episodes of intubation for surgical procedures, she has no other history of airway diseases. She has never had any trauma to her airways. She has no known collagen vascular diseases. She denies history of airway infections or lung infections in the past. She has no current chest pain, no dyspnea at present, no current stridor, no hemoptysis, no neurological or no musculoskeletal complaints. The patient underwent rigid brochoscopy on , which showed a . cm area of stenosis in the mid upper trachea. There was approximately . cm of disease, but salvageable trachea just below the cricoid. The area of severe stenosis started at . cm below the cricoid and extended from . cm until normal trachea was encountered. There was . cm of normal trachea from the distal portion of the stenosis to the carinal spur. Past Medical History: hypertension, depression and previous hysterectomy in . She underwent thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer at age Social History: The patient underwent a divorce approximately years ago and has been diagnosed and treated for depression thereafter. She does not smoke or use illicit drugs. She has a - and -year-old child at home and is engaged. Family History: Significant for type diabetes and a great aunt who had thyroid cancer. No family members have history of airway disorders or collagen vascular diseases or autoimmune diseases. Physical Exam: She is a well-appearing female in no apparent distress and is mildly overweight. She weighs . pounds and is inches tall.

128856.0,": : Service: MEDICINE Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs : Chief Complaint: GI bleeding, hypotension Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: DART Chest tube insertion Colonoscopy History of Present Illness: year old female with a history of hemorrhagic stroke, seizure disorder, and recent fall with resultant pelvic fracture, hypertension, history of rectal prolapse and constipation who initially presented with acute blood loss anemia from lower GI bleeding. The patient prior to hospitalization was at Rehab after her recent Pelvic fracture. The patient at rehab experienced episode of black stool followed by frank hematochezia which continued over next hours including red clots. The patient has never previously experienced GI bleeding and per PCP notes the patient underwent colonoscopy in which was normal. On initial arrival the patient was with BP / which dropped to / on admission, improved to / with L NS and Units PRBCs. The patient received additional unit of blood at am with Hct bump from . to ., stable to . over hours without additional transfusion (Units PRBC total. The patient was seen by GI with initial plan to perform colonoscopy. However, the patient has been noted to have no additional bleeding and was additionally noted to have pneumothorax from CVL placement and tachycardia for which endoscopy was delayed. Given relative stability since initial presentation and cessation of bleeding, decision was made to forego endoscopy at that time. With regards to the murmur this was subsquently confirmed to have been present previously after discussion with the patient's daughter. Echocardiogram was obtained which was revealing for a hyperdynamic LVEF >% and severe resting LVOT gradient and moderate to severe Mitral regurgitation. The patient was seen by cardiology with impression LVOT was likely secondary to longstanding hypertension and now hypovolemia with recommendation to continue beta blockade, maintain normovolemia, and avoid medications that might dramatically lower preload or afterload. Of additional note the patient experienced a complication of a right apical pneumothorax in setting of attempted IJ line placement in the ED. The patient has subsequently had a DART chest tube placed by IR with subsequent near resolution of pneumothorax. On arrival to the floor the patient reported only some mild discomfort over her right lower back and hip. After patient transfer, by lab that bottles from single set of blood cultures from the CVL placement had grown out gram positive cocci, which initially were treated with vancomycin, but ultimately were judged to be contaminant, given no fever and negative peripheral cultures. On she again experienced frank hematochezia, and so underwent repeat colonscopy on , during which they were unable to pass the scope beyond cm due to a stricture. A CT Abdomen revealed a stricture, but no mass, so surgery was consulted, who felt no immediate need for surgery given lack of obstruction. The patient and daughter repeatedly expressed no desire for major surgery. Past Medical History: Hemorrhagic stroke in . Per daughter, patient was unconscious for two days. Once she became conscious, she had significant difficulty producing language. Hemorrhagic stroke in Seizure disorder Her daughter was not sure about the manifestations of the seizures. The patient was previously on Topamax mg , but this was decreased to mg due to concerns about drowsiness due to the Topamax Hypertension rectal prolapse hearing loss hip fracture hyponatremia This was thought to be due to HCTZ which was discontinued. PSH: Rectal prolapse repair Hip fracture repair Social History: Patient has a high school education and was a professional modern dancer. She lives nursing home. She did not smoke but she was exposed to secondhand smoke. She was widowed twenty years ago.

The patient was noted to have poor dentition and had a Dental consultation which determined that the patient was stable for having a coronary artery bypass graft but recommended postoperative extraction of teeth through , and , and repair of the caries in . It was determined that this would be postponed until the patient had been discharged from the hospital. The patient was also noted to have mild thrombocytopenia with an admission platelet count of which had decreased to on . A Hematology Service consultation was obtained. Hematology felt that the patient's admission thrombocytopenia was likely due to alcohol use. The Hematology team recommended perioperative transfusion of platelets. Upon review of the patient's peripheral smear, it was thought that the patient had macrocytosis and mild anemia consistent with myelodysplasia. It was overall felt that the patient was fine to proceed with surgery. It was also noted on that the patient had a significant area of ecchymosis and hematoma in his groin. An ultrasound of his femoral artery revealed a pseudoaneurysm. The Vascular Surgery Service was consulted. Vascular Surgery recommended discontinuing heparin if at all possible and possible compression and re-imaging of the pseudoaneurysm. The heparin drip was held, and pressure was applied to the site of the pseudoaneurysm. Re-imaging by ultrasound showed resolution of the pseudoaneurysm without evidence of arteriovenous fistula. Vascular Surgery felt that there was no further intervention needed. On , the patient was taken to the operating room by Dr. for a coronary artery bypass graft times three with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to second diagonal, and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal.

He hepatitis B with cirrhosis and probable portal hypertension that has accounted for enormous splenomegaly. Also of significance, he had a history of human immunodeficiency virus positivity first diagnosed in . After this initial visit, in order to determine the proper therapy, Dr. requested a inferior venogram. This was radiologist were that the portal pressure gradient measuring between mmHg and mmHg via the right hepatic vein. A carbon dioxide portal cavogram demonstrated patency of the right portal vein and tributaries with suboptimal visualization of the left portal and splenic veins. An inferior vena cavogram showed patency of the inferior vena cava with mass effect to the right secondary to splenomegaly and concentric narrowing of the upper abdominal inferior vena cava. HOSPITAL COURSE: With this information, it was decided to proceed with an operation. On , the patient underwent splenectomy, central splenorenal shunt, as well as a liver biopsy. The surgeon of record was Dr. , and the first assistant for this case was Dr. . The estimated blood loss during this case was liter. The patient received liters of fluid during the case and had a urine output of cc. The patient was extubated after the operation and was sent to the Intensive Care Unit for postoperative monitoring on . The patient received units of fresh frozen plasma and a -pack of platelets to correct a mild coagulopathy as well as a mildly decreased level of platelets. Postoperatively, the patient received hours of intravenous Unasyn. On postoperative day one, his temperature maximum was . degrees. The patient was kept n.p.o. on postoperative day one. He was hemodynamically stable, not requiring any type of pressors. Thus, his arterial line was discontinued, and he was sent to the floor with his right internal jugular central venous line intact. On , postoperative day two, the patient reported passing flatus, and his vital signs remained stable. His abdomen was soft. Thus, his Foley catheter was discontinued as he was making adequate urine, and he was started in sips. The patient did spike a temperature up to . degrees twice on . Thus, blood cultures were sent to the laboratory as was a urine culture. On , the patient clinically continued to do quite well. However, he did have a bump in his total bilirubin level. On it was ., and on it was .. Anmonia level was also taken that day which was . Because of this increase in bilirubin it was decided to send the patient for an ultrasound. This ultrasound showed no flow in the left protal vein, right portal vein, and middle portal vein which was consistent with thrombosis. There was no fluid collection noted, and the superior mesenteric vein was noted to be patent. Dr. discussed these findings with the ultrasonographer, Dr. ; and, at this time, no intervention was planned besides following the patient clinically and continuing to closely monitor the patient's abdominal examination as well as his bilirubin andmonia levels. No flow was expected due to the nature of the central splenorenal shunt that shunts blood into the renal vein. He was advanced to a clear diet on . On , postoperative day four, the patient's bilirubin was ., and hismonia level was . His central line which had been taken out the day before showed no significant growth, and since the patient was clinically doing so well we advanced his diet to regular.

Cholangitis complicated by gram negative bacteremia/sepsis: On presentation, the patient was found to have elevated LFTs in an obstructive pattern. RUQ ultrasound showed a dilated biliary tree. An ERCP was performed on which revealed sludge and pus in the biliary tree. A sphicterotomy was performed and stent placed. She was initially started on vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric cholecystitis coverage, however blood cultures grew out E.coli and urine culture grew out E coli. Given the sensitivity pattern of the E coli found on urine culture, antibiotic coverage was briefly narrowed to ceftriaxone until further sensitivity revealed ESBL in blood so she was switched by meropenem. Follow up blood cultures since initiation of antibiotics are all negative. She remained hemodynamically stable and mental status steadily improved. She will complete two weeks of therapy from the time of sphincterotomy ( start, complete . Meropenem in house will be switched to ertapenem as outpatient for ease of administration ( more days. Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy: Pt was apparently more sedated at her nursing home, which was primary marker of illness per staff. Most likely due to encephalopathy due to infection. Very soon after being treated appropriately with antibiotics her mental status began to improve and she became more responsive. At time of discharge she slept a considerableount but was easily aroused and varyingly interactive and appropriate, which seems to be her baseline. She was awake and eating on day of discharge. Agitated delirium: Pt with agitation as she initially became more responsive in the ICU with periods of scratching and reaching for nurses doing care as well as screaming. Very difficult to understand due to aphasia. Per son and caregivers at nursing home this is not completely outside her baseline and she has a tendency to become agitated with changes in environment or care staff. Usually on risperidone, which helps but in context of being more agitated she refused POs. Eventually, with familiarity with surroundings and nursing, pt improved. Pt did become quite agitated and combative over the weekend. It was a concern on whether this behavior would continue after discharge, eventhough it was thought that she would do better with a familiar setting. Bcx and UCX were repeat in this setting and were PENDING, no growth thus far, at time of discharge. Therefore, geriatrics was involved in her care and her son was called. Pt was seen by Dr. on who felt that pt would be much better served by returning to NH to be in a familiar environment. Pt actually was more calm on day of discharge and did begin to eat and drink. Acute bacterial cystitis: Pt with positive urine culture for >, E coli. Organism should be adequately treated with course of antibiotics for cholangitis/sepsis. See above. Hypotension: The patient experienced SBP down to the s on admission, likely sepsis. Other potential causes included adrenal insufficiency, dehydration, bleeding, and tamponade. Hydration rapidly improved her blood pressure to her normal range as infection was treated. This did not recur on the floor. Afib RVR: On presentation, the patient had a period of A fib with RVR. A likely trigger was thought to be her infection and interstitial edema on CXR. The tachycardia was treated successfully withiodarone, at which point she converted to NSR with periods of A flutter. Due to refusal to take PO diltiazem she was given mg Qhrs with good rate control. No furtherio was given after load and cardioverted as the half life of this medication is quiet long and thus is safe to hold for a limited period while not eating. Pt continued to decline her pills. However, it was felt by her PCP . that pt would be better served back in her primary environment. It pt continues to decline pills, may benefit from goals of care discussion and perhaps no longer treating afib or changing her PO long acting regimen to short acting so that meds can be crushed. Anemia: Hct at presentation but trended up to near . Remained hemodynamically stable from soon after presentation without signs of blood loss. Her niferex iron supplement will be restarted at discharge. HCT . on discharge. . ARF: Cr . on presentation, increased relative to what appears to be her baseline at ., combined with low urine output. The initial diagnosis was pre-renal, but hydration did not immediately improve her renal function suggesting some component of ATN due to hypoperfusion. By time of discharge, however, Cr had fallen to <. Pt did have a foley catheter, but this was removed weekend prior to discharge and pt did not have any voiding difficulties. Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine. TSH found to be slightly elevated (.. Thus, needs outpt f/u. Dementia/Depression: Continued home risperidone (though she refused to take for first of hospitalization and venlafaxine, memantine held due to possibly promoting delirium and will be held at discharge and left at the discretion of PCP to restart. . S/P CVA's: Not on coumadin currently. Also not on ASA. Can discuss the risk/benefits in outpt setting. -Continue BP control, afib control . Transitional issues: -She will need to complete her antibiotics and then have her PICC removed -She will need further management of her neuropharmacologic regimen to help manage what can be very dramatic delirium -She should be scheduled for an ERCP follow up in wks for stent removal -Her mental status should continue to be monitored Medications on Admission: Colace mg qhs Levothyroxine mcg daily Niferex mg daily Dilt ER mg daily Albuterol neb every hours Risperidone mg Senna .mg Amiodarone mg daily Venlafaxine mg Remeron mg qhs Discharge Medications: . venlafaxine mg Tablet Sig: One ( Tablet PO B ( times a day. .iodarone mg Tablet Sig: One ( Tablet PO DAILY (Daily. . mirtazapine mg Tablet Sig: One ( Tablet PO HS (at bedtime. . docusate sodium mg/ mL Liquid Sig: Two ( Tab PO QHS. . senna . mg Tablet Sig: One ( Tablet PO B ( times a day as needed for constipation. . risperidone mg/mL Solution Sig: One ( Mg PO B ( times a day. . diltiazem HCl mg Capsule, Extended Release Sig: One ( Capsule, Extended Release PO once a day. .

Troponin was less than .. Normal liver function tests. HOSPITAL COURSE: . CARDIOVASCULAR: Given the patient's extensive coronary disease, he was admitted for rest angina and ruled out by cardiac enzymes times three. Given nonspecific T wave changes and electrocardiogram, he was continued on a heparin drip, aspirin, Ticlid, and Lipitor and was started on a BA inhibitor upon arrival to given his risk of in-stent thrombosis, as he was only four weeks post stent placement in the right coronary artery. The patient was unable to tolerate a beta blocker. He has a long history of symptomatic bradycardia. The patient was not placed on an ACE inhibitor; as per last admission his blood pressure dropped too low. However, the patient states that his back pain had improved on Norvasc which raised the question of possible vasospasm. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on and was found to have a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of , right atrial pressure of , and pulmonary artery pressure of . His left main coronary artery had an % distal occlusion which was unchanged from prior with left anterior descending artery, diagonal, left circumflex artery supplied by past grafts which were patent. The right coronary artery was noted to have a patent stent with diffuse disease and % right posterolateral branch with slow flow; similar to last cardiac catheterization. This was crossed with a wire and dilated with balloons; however, a cutting balloon was unable to be passed. A % residual stenosis with a moderate nonflow-limiting dissection resulted. The patient became very ill with probable injection of an air bubble in the right coronary artery necessitating transient dopamine and pacing. Repeat attempts at recrossing the right posterolateral branch were not successful, and with normal flow restored the procedure was aborted. An echocardiogram in the catheterization laboratory revealed no significant pericardial effusion. A Foley catheter was inserted with mL of urine drained. The patient was subsequently transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for overnight monitoring; where he remained hemodynamically stable off pressors and without any difficulties. He was transferred to the Cardiology floor on .

History of Present Illness: The patient is a year-old gentleman who has had stuttering chest pain for the last week. He had a stress test which was markedly positive. He was taken urgently to the cath lab due to chest pain which was ongoing after his stress test. His chest pain was relieved in the cath lab at the time of his cardiac cath with the insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump. Diagnostic cath revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease with relatively well preserved left ventricular function. His ejection fraction was estimated at to % by LV gram. His left main was % stenotic. There was a second obtuse marginal coronary artery which had an % stenosis. The LAD coronary artery had a proximal % stenosis followed by a mid % stenosis. There was a large first diagonal coronary artery which was in between the lesions in the LAD. The right coronary artery was subtotally occluded and filled the posterior descending and posterior lateral vessels very poorly. The patient was very stable overnight on medications as well as the intra-aortic balloon pump. The patient was felt to be a good candidate for urgent surgical revascularization. The patient understood the risks and benefits of the procedure, including but not limited to bleeding, infection, myocardial infarction, stroke, death, renal and pulmonary insufficiency, as the possibility of a blood transfusion and future revascularization procedures.
