PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA OR STUDIES ON ADMISSION: White count ., hematocrit ., platelets , Chem- unremarkable. Chest-ray showed no consolidation, no widening of the mediastinum, no effusion, no lymphadenopathy noted. CTA showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus but showed a cm SVC thrombus with retrograde flow through azygous and lumbar veins returning to the heart via the inferior vena cava. No evidence of pulmonary consolidation. CT head also done in the Emergency Department showed no evidence of metastatic disease. BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE: -year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to lungs, liver, and bone apparently oneloda and Herceptin being admitted for superior vena cava syndrome secondary to thrombus. . Superior vena cava clot: The patient was noted to have a cm clot in her superior vena cava likely related to her Port-A-Cath which was involved with the clot, according to Radiology secondary report. The patient was immediately placed on a Heparin drip, and consideration for thrombectomy versus other Interventional Radiology procedures was considered. Given the patient's significant symptoms of dyspnea as well as facial swelling, she was started on a TPA infusion for a total of hours. The TPA infusion was per an Interventional Radiology protocol, and the patient was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit during this infusion period. The patient was monitored for signs of bleeding. During the infusion the patient's Heparin drip was decreased, and she was closely monitored for neurologic, bleeding, or other signs of bleeding. The TPA was infused through her Port-A-Cath. The infusion was mg per hour times eight hours then . mg per hour times hours. PT, INR, fibrinogen, platelets, and hematocrits were followed during this infusion. If her fibrinogen was less than , her TPA dose would be decreased by half, and if it was less than her TPA would be discontinued completely. The patient's fibrinogen remained stable throughout, and her TPA was tolerated well. The repeat CTA showed complete clearance of clot along wall of the superior vena cava and a very small filling defect. There was a fibrin sheath or residual clot--it was unclear--along the terminal portion of the Port-A-Cath just above tip. Given the small filling defect and likely fibrin sheath on the Port-A-Cath, further intervention was considered with Interventional Radiology as well as Surgery. The consideration included balloon angioplasty and/or catheter stripping through Interventional Radiology versus a surgical advancement of the catheter tip for improved placement. There was thought that the current catheter placement was likely causing some vessel wall injury which led to the clot formation. A final decision was made to have the patient fully anticoagulated on Coumadin for a goal INR of between and . After approximately one month of full anticoagulation, Dr. , who is the Surgical consult, agreed to advance the catheter into the right atrium to avoid further vessel injury and likely further clot formation. A total of six months of anticoagulation was recommended by Dr. and the interventional radiologists. In addition, Dr. recommended to avoid sclerosing agents to be used in the Port-A-Cath, which may cause additional vessel wall injury and possible clot formation. The patient remained in hospital until her INR became therapeutic on Coumadin while on her Heparin drip until her INR was between and . She received two days of mg of Coumadin and was transitioned to mg q. day as an outpatient. She will have an INR checked in one day upon discharge and will be adjusted by Dr. and then again in two days, in which Dr. will adjust her Coumadin dosing. . Oncology: The patient received two Herceptin treatments while in hospital, continuing with her weekly Herceptin, without any complications. She was also continued on her dailyeloda treatment and her Femara. The patient's blood counts were followed closely without any evidence of neutropenia or anemia. The patient had an MRI of her pelvis done to evaluate her persistent hip pain. The MRI results were pending upon her discharge. The patient's pain was fairly well controlled with her Fentanyl patch and p.r.n. Tylenol. The patient receivedeloda mg p.o. q. a.m. and mg p.o. q. p.m. for days. She is on a two-week on and one-week off schedule. .

MICU admission was requested for frequent vital monitoring and hct checks prior to endoscopy. She went to MICU on . Her hct was stable in the ICU and she remained hemodynamically stable. She went for EGD the afternoon of and was transferred back to the floor. Her hospital course is described by problem below. . GI Bleed - Extensive discussion with the patient and her daughter revealed that they did not want a colonoscopy done nor did they want extensive procedures or surgeries. The patient's DNR/DNI status was confirmed and treatments would be symptomatic. A EGD was acceptable in case there was an on going bleed which could be easily intervened on. EGD showed large sliding hiatal hernia and a few non-bleeding ulcers in teh GE junction above the hernia. These ulcers were believed to be the source of bleeding. She was monitored with serial Hct which were stable (. on discharge. She was being treated with twice daily pantoprazole for the ulcers and stool softeners for her chronic rectal prolapse. She continues to have guiac positive stools. Hct should be checked on to ensure no active blood loss needing transfusion. She will be discharged on omeprazole . . Hypernatremia: After the episode of GI bleeding, she became hypernatremic to . Her free water deficit was calculated to be .L and she was repleted with DW and her hypernatremia resolved. .

Per referral notes, she was reported to have shortness of breath with use of accessory muscles. Referral note recorded full code. . In the ED per report and review of records, she was noted to have a rapid heart rate to 's-'s, consistent with atrial fibrillation. Due to respiratory distress, she was intubated with mg of succinyl choline, and initiated on phenylephirine for blood pressure support--initially she was hypertensive with systolic to . A central line was placed She also received grams of cefepime, mg of levofloxacin, mg of solumedrol, mg aspirin, and mg ofiodarone. En route, it was reported that she had bradycardia with heart rate to -, without hypotension. . Upon arrival to ED, once cardiac monitor was attached, no pulse was noted. At that time-- AM, and chest compressions were initiated. She received epinephrine three times and atropine once, as well as gram of calcium. At : AM, ventricular tachycardia was noted, and patient was shocked with joules. Levophed was initiated and she was resuscitated with intravenous fluids, per report liters prior to transfer. She also received gram of vancomycin and . grams of piperacillin-tazobactam. She was also initiated oniodarone drip to help improve control of her heart rate, which was -'s after return of circulation. . Imaging of the CT chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed thrombosed aorta below the renal arteries. Vascular surgery was consulted and felt that the occlusion was chronic, given the degree of collaterals noted in the iliacs. There was also noted to be a question of gall bladder edema, possibly consistent with cholecysitis. General surgery was consulted, and HA scan was recommended to rule out acute cholecystitis. . Cardiology was also consulted, given history of coronary artery disease, AF, and systolic heart failure. It was recommended that amiodarone continue for her tachycardia, along with levophed for blood pressure. .

There was concern for an HIV-associated pancytopenia but also for DIC, specifically with regard to the anemia and thrombocytopenia, so DIC labs were checked but showed no signs of DIC with fibrinogen always > , and coags were slightly elevated on admission but remained stable with no significant elevations. Haptoglobin and bilirubin were within normal limits. The PCP was for further information who stated that the pancytopenia has been a problem for years. The patient's leukopenia was attributed to her HIV/AS with a possible septic component. Her anemia was likely anemia of chronic inflammation from her HIV/AS. Thrombocytopenia was attributed to HIV/AS. Her counts were followed closely throughout her ICU stay. The patient did require on transfusion for a hematocrit of with an appropriate bump to . Stool guaiacs were negative and the change was attributed to vigorous hydration with a reported significant blood loss during central line placement.

On days prior to this admission, he was admitted after he scraped his right shin on a shuttle bus. He gotIG, and was discharged on . On this admission, he presented fever and was empirically started on vancomycin and cefepime. He developed a headache on HD, which was initially thought to be related toIG. On HD, he was somnolent / confused, so an LP was done on . CSF studies revealed elevated protein, concerning for viral / aseptic meningitis. He was started on foscarnet empirically on , but this was stopped when CSF studies came back negative for HHV. His mental status improved and the etiology of headache and altered mental status remains unclear to date. He developed acute hypoxemia and was discovered to have an acute pulmonary embolus, provoked by prolonged immobilization and inability to anticoagulate because of thrombocytopenia. Submassive pulmonary embolus - The patient developed acute hypoxemia on , was found to have a large pulmonary embolus involving the right main with extension into the upper, middle, and lower segmental arteries, and was started on a heparin drip. LENI showed bilateral deep venous thrombi, so he was brought emergently to the cath lab forC filter placement. He was brought to the CCU after his thrombectomy and did well. He he was maintained on heparin drip because of thrombocytopenia. Once he was able to maintain his platelet count with every other day platelet transfusions, he was started on subcutaneous lovenox. He developed bleeding complications and was found to be supratherapeutic with the mg/kg dosing of enoxaparin, so he was placed on mg/kg DAILY enoxaparin, and factora levels were appropriate. - Anticoagulation should be continued for months for provoked pulmonary embolus, andC filter should be removed at the same time (around Fever - Had one isolated fever . on . He was started empirically on vancomycin, cefepime. No definitive source was identified. Possible localizing sources: CNS, line infection, cellulitis (however left lower extremity appeared to be healing well and did not appear to be infected or cellulitic, GI (had watery diarrhea on the day he spiked a fever. Most concerning was HHV encephalitis, so he was started empirically on foscarnet as described below. CSF studies were negative for HHV, EBV, HSV. Also possible is foscarnet reaction (has previously had fever & diarrhea with foscarnet. Because he remained afebrile and his WBC counts recovered, antibiotics were stopped on , and he remained afebrile.

Counts remain low and seem to fluctuate somewhat in the setting of his medications and infections. - We continued his anti-rejection regimen with methylprednisolone, sirolimus, and tacrolimus. Methylprednisolone was tapered. - Prophylaxis was continued with atovaquone, fluconazole. Valgancyclovir held while on foscarnet. He receives monthly IVIG, last received . - Scheduled bone marrow biopsy from revealed no evidence of leukemia but hypocellular marrow with erythroid & megakaryocytic dyspoiesis Pancytopenia: Chronic pancytopenia likely due to hypoproliferation and recurrent infections. He got neupogen on and for downtrending WBCs with good response. Altered mental status / headache / concern for viral encephalitis - Originally presented with headache which improved withF, thought most likely related toIG received . CT head was negative for hemorrhage. The patient had altered mental status . There was concern for HHV encephalitis because the patient has a personal history of HHV encephalitis and a persistently elevated HHV viral load. Lumbar puncture was performed. CSF studies were positive for elevated protein, consistent with possible aseptic meningitis, so he was started on foscarnet, but was discontinued when CSF HHV was confirmed negative. Headache and altered mental status improved. Etiology remains unclear. CMV viremia - He is on valgancyclovir prophylaxis at home. Valgancyclovir was held in the setting of pancytopenia to allow counts to recover. He developed a positive CMV viral load. He was seen by infectious diseases and was discharged on a suppressive dose of valgancyclovir with infectious disease follow-up. Orthostatic hypotension: The patient has a h/o orthostatic hypotension on fludrocortisone at home. Orthostatic hypotension was unresponsive to fluids which suggests he has a degree of adrenal insufficiency. Of note, methylprednisone has been tapered as he is now > days out from transplant. CAD/hypertension: Continued home nifedipine. Diabetes: Patient developed hypoglycemia while tapering methylprednisone, so home glargine was decreased from U to U, and he was maintained on a sliding scale with humalog.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane. Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent hospitalization. You came in with a fever and were neutropenic so we started you on antibiotics. We did not identify a clear source of your fevers but they resolved without antibiotics upon discharge. Early in your hospitalization, you complained of headaches and we were concerned that you seemed a bit confused, so you got a lumbar puncture because you have a history of HHV encephalitis. You were treated briefly with foscarnet but the spinal fluid did not grow HHV, so we stopped the foscarnet. Your headaches improved upon discharge. One week into your hospitalization, your oxygen levels dropped and we discovered that you have a large clot in your lungs, which was most likely caused by your prolonged hospitalization which made it difficult for you to walk around. You developed blood clots in your legs, which can travel to your lungs. The treatment for pulmonary embolus is anticoagulation with heparin. You were placed on a heparin until your platelet counts were adequate, then we started you on enoxaparin (lovenox shots. You were seen by dermatology for a skin rash on your right shin. They felt it was a simple hematoma (bruise. Nonetheless you should follow-up in dermatology clinic as an outpatient. It is very important that you keep the following appointments we have made for you.

Brief Hospital Course: year-old man with history of COPD, diabetes, hepatitis C and prior alcohol use who presents with hypercarbia and chronic upper extremity swelling. . . Hypercarbia: Patient has a known history of COPD with prior bicarb values in the high s. No prior ABG to assess pCO in past. ABG indicated large degree of hypercarbia with respiratory acidosis, though the level of acidemia does not seem as severe as the hypercarbia which may suggest chronicity. He briefly required BIPAP, which rapidly improved his hypercarbia and pH to closer to baseline level. He continued to have well compensated hypercarbia thoughout his stay. He was initially given azithromycin and prednisone, both were discontinued before he was discharged. He was given nebulizers throughout his stay. - cont Nebs (atrovent and albuterol . . Upper extremity swelling: Unclear etiology. Though he does appear to have TR there is no lower extremity swelling which would be more consistent. A portal or liver process is possible as well, especially given his prior alcohol use, hepatitis and the presence of RUQ pain. The liver and spleen were unremarkable on CT in . The possibility of a complication s/p Whipple could be considered given the temporal association. LFTs were normal during his stay and no further workup was undertaken. His swelling improved transiently while on prednisone, but whether the prednisone contributed to the improvement is unclear. . . History of PE withC filter: Patient states he is currently on coumadin though his INR is not therepeutic. In speaking with the sister and patient, this is for prior PE in . From discussion with his PCP, did not restart coumadin in a previous admission as she felt his risks outweighted the benefits given history of GI bleed. He was given sc heparin for prophylaxis during his stay. . . Diabetes: He was given his home NPH as well as SSI. He did require extra insulin while taking steroids. His insulin should continue to be titrated to his blood sugars as they are probably currently transiently unstable from his hospital stay and prednisone. . . Hypertension: He has had a somewhat wide range of SBP. He may benefit from an antihypertensive as an outpatient, but we have not started him on one here. . . Seizure disorder: Continued on keppra . .

Brief Hospital Course: y.o. man with severe CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF -%, and PVD presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath in the context of Hct of . GI Bleed / Acute Blood loss anemia: Patient presented with chest pain and a history of days of black, pasty stool and was found to have a supratherapeutic INR at . and a hemoglobin of .. INR was reversed with vitamin K. A CT torso was performed to look for other sources of bleeding as GI losses were not brisk, but was negative for any evidence of hemorrhage. The patient received received a total of units of blood until hemoglobin stabilized around .. EGD on showed patchy friability and erythema of the mucosa were noted in the antrum consistent with gastritis. The patient was placed on mg omeprazole. Given gastritis was felt probably inadequate to cause that degree of bleeding patient went on to have a colonoscopy that showed an ischemic ulcer and cecal AVMs, which was felt to explain his bleeding. We felt that he had likely bled slowly from his AVMs, and then developed the ulcer after his Hct was low. CAD / Chest Pain: The patient presented with substernal chest pressure, dyspnea, and diaphoresis to the outside hospital with EKG changes. Likely etiology of this was demand ischemia in the context of severe anemia. Patient originally was put on heparin drip at OSH but given his troponins returned not significantly elevated with flat MBs, INR was therapeutic, and he his pain improved with transfusion this was stopped and this was treated as demand ischemia. Troponin peaked at . and CK at suggesting any degree of mycoardial injury likely extremely small and echo showed EF of % which sounds compatible with previous echocardiogram. On presentation the patient's aspirin and clopidogrel was held but Aspirin restarted when hematocrit stabilized. Clopidogrel was restarted. The patient's cardiologist agreed with plans to perform an outpatient stress test as needed. We decided to defer repeat echo as well, given stable echo at time of anemia, and lack of CP or HF active symptoms. Patient also with angiogram in without eivdence of occlussive disease, per d/w Dr . Discussed with prior consulting cardiology team as well as Dr on , who felt that outpatient work-up as needed would be reasonable. Stressed importance of close follow-up and glycemic control with the patient, to reduce risk of recurrent MI. Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient had known systolic CHF with previous EF of around % per his report. On presentation to he did have acute exacerbation of CHF with volume overload in the context of likely transient ischemia due to anemia and multiple transfusions leading to massive expansion of volume. He received BiPAP and furosemide on presentation and improved rapidly. Furosemide was then held in the context bleeding but home maintenance dose restarted on as was digoxin (beta blocker had already been restarted. TTE showed EF -% with dilated left ventricle (likely consistent with prior so etiology of acute decompensation at presentation likely reversed ischemia and volume from transfusions. The patient was not started on an ACE I given his limited follow-up and the need for close monitoring which would not be available at this time. History of Atrial Fibirllation and DVT's with Elevated INR: Patient presented with INR .. Reversed with FFP and vitamin K now and returned to subtherapeutic and coumadin continued to be held due to occult GI bleed pending work up. Unclear why INR was supratherapeutic as patient reports long term stability on regimen. Denies any recent changes in diet or any alcohol intake. No new medications. Patient does report that he buys his medications, including coumadin, off the ""black market"", so it is possible that he took incorrectly labeled pills. We suggested that the patient restart his warfarin after consulting his cardiologist within several days from discharge. DM: Patient has uncontrolled DM, and reports he does not take insulin as directed. He was put on glargine and sliding scale in house (which is his intended home regimen with reasonable control of blood glucose. We provided diabetic teaching prior to discharge. Insomnia, chronic: Pt has received trazodone over home zolpidem, will restart zolpidem as this is likely contributing to insomnia FEN: heart healthy/low sodium today, clears for dinner, NPO afer MN PPx: heparin SC Code: FULL, confirmed Dispo: Patient appropriate for discharge to home. Discussed with the patient and his wife at the bedside for over minutes regarding discharge plans. Patient is aware of follow-up needs and the importance of working with a new internist despite his insurance status, for his ongoing medical needs. TRANSITONAL ISSUES: -Restart anticoagulation once he sees his cardiologist. -Incident pulmonary nodules per above -Should be on ACEi at some point, but not until he has clear and regular follow-up. -The patient should establish care with an internist, and plans to do this once home.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. Discharge Instructions: Mr , It was a pleasure to care for you during your admission. As you know, you were admitted with chest pain that was likely due to poor blood flow to your heart in the setting of a very low red blood cell count. We believe that you had bleeding from your GI tract that caused the low blood count, but has since improved. You received blood and your symptoms resolved. Thankfully, it appears that very little heart muscle was damaged, and your pump function is the same as Dr has measured in the past. We did investigations to determine the source of your bleeding (the colonoscopy that showed the blood vessel changes (AVMs in the cecum at the point between the small bowel and the colon, as well as the ulcer that resembled an area of ischemia or temporarily decreased blood flow. Neither of those areas were actively bleeding, but likely both contributed to your anemia. We held your warfarin while you were here, as a result of your blood loss, and would like for you to see Dr within several days as noted below, to discuss restarting this medication. We wanted to give your bowel a chance to heal before you restart this medication. Your medications have been changed temporarily, as your blood pressure here has been -. -You should take twice daily pantoprazole for one month, then decrease back to once daily. -Warfarin is being held for a few more days, until ( weeks total. -Decreaseiodarone to mg ( tablet -Decrease metoprolol to .mg twice daily (from -mg -Decrease digoxin to .mcg ( tablet -HOLD diltiazem until you see Dr aldactone until you see Dr isosorbide until you see Dr insulin (glargine to units at bedtime and continue your usual sliding scale. You will need the help of Dr to make further adjustments. Note: Please do not exceed grams of tylenol daily, as we discussed. This medication can interact with your warfarin, amiodarone and other medications. Followup Instructions: We discussed that either speaking with Dr or a new PCP is very important. We feel that you would benefit from close monitoring of your blood sugars, and adjustment of several of your medications. We hope that you will find a doctor either through the VA system or locally that can help you with your long-term health issues. Please schedule an appointment to see Dr within - days, where he should check your INR and CBC (blood counts, as well as your heart rate and blood pressure. We suggest that he restarts your warfarin if your counts are stable, and also will need to help you get back on your heart medications gradually. You should also discuss with Dr about further monitoring of your heart conditions, including adjustments that might be needed of your digoxin andiodarone. Your biopsies are still pending. The GI office can be reached at if you do not hear back within one week. You can also call and ask for the GI office.

Pancreatitis: Appears most likely to be due to gallstones or biliary sludge despite lack of evidence of cholelithiasis on OSH CT scans. There is no history of recent EtOH use, and the patient was not hypercalcemic or hyperlipidemic on admission to the OSH. She was not taking any medications known to cause pancreatitis, and there was no antecedent viral prodrome or trauma. By all lab parameters, her pancreatitis is improving, but the severity of her pancreatitis is worsening by CT scanning. Her pancreatic inflammation also appears to have resulted in significant pleural effusions that now appear to be causing signficant tachypnea and hypoxemia (see below. - NPO - Maintenance fluids - Pain control with hydromorphone as needed - RUQ U/S now to evaluate for cholelithiasis or cholecystitis . Fever and Leukocytosis: be attributable to worsening pancreatitis given increasing severity on CT scan. There is clear concern for a secondary bacterial infection, however.

REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY : In the awake state, there was voltage reduction in the right parasagittal region and occasional slowing on the right accompanying drowsiness. There was earlier onset of drowsiness on the right versus the left. ABNORMALITY : Later in the study, there were runs of polymorphic theta with rare sharps over the left central region during drowsiness. BACKGROUND: Throughout the recording the background rhythm remained slow typically reaching a . Hz maximum. HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed. INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed. SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were seen. CARDIAC MONITOR: Revealed a generally regular rhythm with average rate of bpm. IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to persistent decreased voltage in the right parasaggital and frontal region. Additionally, the slow background suggests a mild encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection areong the most common causes. There were no clearly epileptiform feature.

A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present. The motion of the mitral valve prosthetic discs appeas normal. The gradients are higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. No mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mechanical aortic valve prosthesis with increased gradient. Bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis with good disc motion, but increased gradient. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Preserved global biventricular systolic function. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Based on AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate prophylaxis IS recommended. Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data. , F Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of : PM , NSURG FA : PM CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Clip Reason: ? change in bleed MEDICAL CONDITION: year old woman s/p SDH w evacuation, seizure REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ? change in bleed CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR CONTRAST: None.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. , F Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of OBJECT: Bedside LTM withvideo ekg . THERE WERE NO PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS. ROUTINE SAMPLING AND SPIKE AND SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS WERE UTILIZED. REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY : There was prominent fast activity in the left temporal region. ABNORMALITY : Intermittent and isolated slow sharp waves were noted in the left posterior temporal region. ABNORMALITY : Throughout the recording the background rhythm remained slow typically reaching a Hz maximum. ABNORMALITY : There was decreased voltage noted in the right parasagittal and frontal regions. HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed. INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed. SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were seen. CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm. IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG telemetry study due to a slow background in the theta range which suggests a widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures. There was breech artifact as well as isolated slow sharp wave activity in the left temporal region. Finally, the decreased voltage in the right parasagittal and frontal regions may present diffuse cortical injury or possible residual subdural hematoma. There were no epilpetiform features. INTERPRETED BY: , L. Brief Hospital Course: This pt was admitted through the emergency department for acute left sdh / on coumadin. INR was reversed on admission - She was taken to the OR emergently for evacuation of the collection. Post operative day she had focal sz activity that was described as twitching movements of angle of mouth on the right side. This was followed by twitching movement of her Right upper limb upto hand after few seconds. The entire episode lasted for less than minute. She was seen by the neurology service and their recommendations were followed. Cardiology consult was obtained for guidance in anticoagulation for her mechanical heart valves. She started on ASA on day . On day a heparin drip was started / wt based, for her mechanical heart valves. Surface echo was performed. She is due to start coumadin on monday the while in rehab.

120768.0,": : : Sex: M Service: NMED Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs : Chief Complaint: vertigo, nausea, vomiting Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Interventricular Cerebral Drain placed and removed. History of Present Illness: This is a yo RH man with no significanth who presented to the ED at for evaluation of sudden onset vertigo, ""eyes moving to the right"" and then vomiting while having dinner. There were no complaints of headache. ECG in the ED revealed ST depressions in V-V wiht elevated troponin, so heparin gtt was started for hr, and pt was given asa. There was a brief episode of a.fib in the ED as well, controlled with metoprolol. In the ED the patient began to become somewhat somnelent, and went for head CT which revealed L cerebellar hemorrhage, into lateral ventricles. Subsequent MRI also revealed old L corona radiata stroke. Unclear whether there was an underlying ischemic stroke before the bleed or not. He was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring, and Neurosurgery placed a vent drain which did not drain much fluid, and has now been discontinued. The patient remained stable in the ICU, and is now transferred out with only some residual vertigo, esp. while sitting up. Cardiology has also consulted on Mr. and suggested treatment of bp with B-blockers, and if a.fib returns to startiodarone for rx. They also recommend outpatient stress test for further risk stratification.

No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (EF %. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Head CT: There is a mild to moderateount of hemorrhage within both lateral ventricles tracking down to the third and fourth ventricles. A x . cm hemorrhage area is also seen in the left cerebellar hemisphere. There is no evidence of hydrocephalus or mass effect. There is no shift of normally midline structures. the density values of the remaining brain parenchyma are within normal limits. The surruouding soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable. Brain MRI/MRA: The hemorrhage in the left cerebellar hemisphere is identified, together with the blood, which has dissected into the ventricular system. Multiple lacunar infarcts are identified, including some within the pons. There is a focus of restricted diffusion in the left posterior frontal white matter, which has a slight increased signal on TW sequence, consistent with subacute infarction. There are multiple T high signal intensity foci consistent with microvascular angiopathy. A shunt catheter has been placed since the CT scan with its tip in a position appropriate for right lateral ventricle. There is no evidence of a focal extraaxial lesion or fluid collection. Multiple punctate hemorrhages are noted in the cerebellar hemisphere and in the basal ganglia. This patient is rather young, and the distribution of the foci of presumed hemorrhage are atypical, but it would raise the question ofyloid angiopathy. MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF AND ITS MAJOR TRIBUTARIES: There is no evidence of aneurysm or flow abnormality. There is no evidence of high-flow vascular abnormality in the left cerebellar hemishere. Carotid Ultrasound: Right less than % and left -% ICA stenoses and antegrade flow in the vertebral arteries. Brief Hospital Course: Mr. was admitted initially to the Neurosurgery Service, and a interventricular drain was placed, however never drained any fluid. Head CTs remained unchanged. The patient had no further episodes of a.fib, and no futher chest pain. He was stabilized in the ICU with his blood pressure under control, and he underwent a full stroke work-up. It was felt that he likely had ischemic strokes in the cerebellum and left corona radiata and that these were due to his new onset a.fib. Probably the hemorrhage came about after the heparin was started in the ED for the ECG changes and troponin leak, however the true course of events cannot be absolutely determined. His Cholesterol was checked, and Total Cholesterol , Triglycerides , HDL , LDL . He was started on lipitor. Additionally, Cardiology consulted, and felt that if a.fib started again, to startiodarone (which did not have to be done - and also felt that due to the cardiac issues on this admission, wall abnormalities and decreased EF seen on the echo - that he should have follow up outpatient stress testing. Mr. did well throughout the rest of the admission and worked with PT/OT extensively once out on the floor.

CT head No acute intracranial pathological process. If there is concern for subtle mass or acute brain ischemia, MRI is more sensitive, if no contraindication to MRI is present. . CXR As best can be compared across modalities, the appearance of the radiograph currently is relatively stable compared to the CT scan demonstrating a moderate-to-large left pleural effusion, left lower lobe collapse, and scattered parenchymal opacities, particularly in the left apex and in the right middle lobe. Bronchiectasis is also noted anteriorly in the right lung as well. . CTA of chest IMPRESSION: . No filling defect in the pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolus. . Bilateral multifocal scarring, ground-glass opacities, and traction bronchiectasis could be sequela of prior ARDS. . Prominent lymph nodes in the mediastinum and right hilum, stable to prior. . Persistent left lower lobe collapse with associated small left pleural effusion which appears slightly loculated. Endobronchial lesion is not seen on CT; however, narrowing of second and third level bronchi is suggested and bronchoscopy can be considered. . ECHO The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >%. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets ( appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed of , the RV is now more dilated. . CXR Comparison is made with prior study from nine hours earlier. There is new total collapse of the left lower lobe. There are no other acute interval changes, no pneumothorax. . Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Small right apical pneumothorax has minimally decreased in size. ET tube tip is . cm above the carina. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Left lower lobe collapse is persistent. Multifocal consolidations in the upper lobes bilaterally, left worse than right and in the right middle lobe are grossly unchanged. Left pleural effusion have minimally increased. . REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Any evidence of pneumothorax? Worsening? Wet Read: JXKc WED : AM Previously seen right pneumothorax is not clearly seen on this study. Stable LLL collapse. Final Report HISTORY: Possible pneumothorax on prior chest-ray with additional desaturations this morning, evaluate for any evidence of pneumothorax. COMPARISON: at : a.m. and at : p.m. CHEST, SINGLE AP UPRIGHTEW: No definite pneumothorax is identified with the previously seen right pneumothorax not clearly visualized. There has been no other short interval change. The endotracheal tube tip terminates cm from the carina. The NG tube is in stomach and the right internal jugular venous catheter terminates in the SVC. Left lower lobe collapse is persistent, with a left pleural effusion unchanged in size. Opacities in the left upper lobe and right mid and lower lung are stable. IMPRESSION: . No pneumothorax identified with the previously seen right apical pneumothorax not clearly visualized. . Stable-appearing left lower lobe collapse and left pleural effusion . Brief Hospital Course: MICU Course . year old gentleman with chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure recently discharged from rehab who initially presented with fatigue, lethargy and acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and who progressed to worsening hypercarbia and clinical deterioration including hypotension and respiratory distress requiring intubation. . Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Acute on chronic (given extensive hx including ARDS,malnutrition, deconditioning. He had CT evidence of left lower lobe collapse which was somewhat chronic in nauture but was placed on broad antibiotics with cefepime, vancomycin, and cipro. Sputum cultures grew pseudomonas with interediate sensitibity to cefipime which he was on and full sensitivity toikacin. As he remianed febrile and hypotensive we had planned intitiation ofikcacin but then goals of care evolved to cofort as below. . Bradycardia: Episodes of brady to s-s. Likely due to high vagal tone and possible contribution form changes in intrathoracic pressure exacerbated by left lower lung collapse and ynamic right apical PTX. Notably after small right apical PTX seen on one CXR, it resolved on plain films and CT has been planned to evaluate but goals of care evolved. Shock- infectious as most likely source. Attempted to fluid resuscitate to optimal CVPs. Continue broad coverage abx for PNA, until patient was made DNR and eventually had comfort care implemented after a family meeting. . Depression/Anxiety: Continue celexa, remeron, prn ativan, held standing klonopin to avoid altering mental status . . Gastritis: Continued PPI . . Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine, check TSH . . h/o C diff: Continued lactinex, avoid empiric antibiotics if possible . Macrocytic anemia: HCT initially on admission; has been stable in mid s but now at . Continued iron supplements. . Patient's family convened and made decision for comfort measures only after discussions with Dr and Dr . Patient was started on a morphine drip and extubated at approximately : PM. Family was at bedside and patient's clinical status quickly deteriorated, though he appeared comfortable on the morphine drip. Noticed asystole on telemetry and went to see patient. He was unresponsive. No visible chest rise or respirations. There were no heart sounds or breath sounds on auscultation. There was no palpable carotid pulse. Pupils were fixed and dilated and corneal reflexes were absent. Time of death was : PM.
