DDimer Brief Hospital Course: Ms. is a year old female with asthma, DM, HTN, vertigo, depression, CVA, admitted for shortness of breath and chest pain asthma exacerbation who developed hyperglycemia in the setting of missing her insulin while in the ED, receiving steroids and her insulin underdosed on the floor, transferred to the MICU for insulin gtt. Hyperglycemia: Likely secondary to steroids and missed/underdosing of insulin upon admission. Of note, patient's unmanaged OSA was felt likely a contributor to her insulin resistance (hyperadrenergic from episodic apnea. Patient did not have a gap throughout this and her electrolytes were regularly checked. Patient was initially on an insulin gtt with close monitoring also by . Patient was initially NPO in the ICU on maintainance fluids (normal saline with plan to either resume diet when blood sugars < or transition to D/. Given the possibility of confusing U: with U: on the floor, patient's insulin doses were converted to U:. Plan was for patient to be given lantus units and the insulin gtt stopped four hours later with initiation of a tight sliding scale. Patient's blood sugars remained persistently high, however, so her insulin gtt was continued, recs, at high doses (- units per hour. There was concern on the second day in the MICU that patient's brother was bringing her fast foods inconsistent with the hospital diabetic diet, resulting in volatile blood sugars up to +. Ultimately, patient was transferred to the floor on NPH in the morning and units before bed and tight humalog sliding scale. continued to folllow patient closely on the floor. She was discharged home after completion of pulse-dose steroids on her home insulin regimen. Shortness of Breath/COPD exacerbation: Likely multifactorial, consistent with previous asthma exacerbations (wheezing, decreased peak flow, improvement with nebs and steroids and patient with notable restrictive component to her SBO due to obesity and deconditioning. also have evolving pulm htn from OSA and not wearing bipap at home. No signs of PNA (CXR unchanged, no cough, fever, white count. CHF unlikely (NL echo , no edema or JVD, no CXR evidence. PE remained a possibility given her tachycardia (although baseline HR-s per OMR, immobilization and recent initiation ofolair. D dimer checked and was , which is similar or less than three prior hospitalizations in the past months with similar presentations. Each time, D-Dimer obtained, D-Dimer was mildly positive, and pt was ruled out for PE by negative V/Q scan, treated for Asthma exacerbation and improved. Given this hx, PE was felt unlikely and VQ scan was not pursued. Patient was continued on Prednisone mg daily for presumed asthma exacerbation, albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers, home anti-leukotriene and Advair. Patient was continued on her home CPAP which she is not compliant with at home but was compliant with in-house. Patient also received one dose Magnesium for management of her asthma as she remained persistently wheezy until day of transfer out of MICU. Given the extreme elevations in her blood sugar and the fact that patient's symptoms had completely resolved by the time of transfer to the floor, a -day pulse dose course of steroids at mg daily was felt preferable to taper. The patient was kept in-house until completion of the pulse course, and then discharged home on her usual insulin regimen. Chest Pain: Reproducible with palpation so felt likely MSK/non-cardiac chest pain. Unlikely ACS as no EKG changes, CE negative . GI related pain also possible, but unlikely reflux given pt on Omeprazole and Ranitidine at home. Cardiac enzymes negative for myocardial ischemic/infarction. Patient's chest pain was managed with Morphine initially and did not require further pain medications for chest pain. Upon transfer to floor, did request narcotic analgesia for chronic back pain. Patient was continued on home Omeprazole and Ranitidine with good effect. Of note, in discussions with her primary care provider, was not prescibed narcotics prior upon discharge given on-going issues regarding this matter. Vulvovaginal itch: Likely yeast infection in setting of significantly elevated blood sugars. Patient was given a dose of Diflucan and started on Miconazole cream without significant relief of her symptoms. She received second dose of Diflucan prior to transfer to floor. Psychiatric: Patient became agitated overnight on Day in the MICU, refusing subcutaneous heparin, becoming combative and threw a pitcher of water. Patient then proceeded to remove telemetry and other lines to leave AMA. Code Purple was called and House Staff in conjunction with Security were able to persuade patient to stay. She received a dose of Valium and pain medications; she slept through the night. Patient has a history of combative agitation towards staff in the past and has been seen by psychiatry in-house. Social Work consult was ordered in MICU and patient will likely benefit from Psychiatric follow-up. Tachycardia: Likely anxiety, pain and inhalers. Less likely PE. Noted to be tachy to - range at clinic visits in OMR. Hypertension: Patient normotensive on arrival to the ICU and was continued on her home lisinopril. Peripheral Neuropathy: Continued on home gabapentin, amitriptyline, lidocaine patch Spinal Stenosis: Seen as outpatient by pain clinic with recent steroid injection in Januuary. HLD: Continued home simvastatin Depression: Continued on Doxepin and social work was consulted for patient coping with asthma/blood sugars Vertigo: Continued on home Diazepam PRN (did not require GERD: Continued on ranitidine and omeprazole Urinary Rentention: Patient reported urinary retention in the ED so a Foley was placed. Unclear if a bladder scan was initially done. Urinalysis was negative. Foley was discontinued upon discharge to floor. OSA: Patient reports having CPAP at home though not usually wearing it and had refused it on the floor prior to transfer to MICU. She wasenable to CPAP and demonstrated good compliance while in the ICU. Fxnal Status: Patient is wheelchair bound with limited mobility at baseline.

Pt was admitted for similar sx's in . Pt states on the morning of admission at about a.m. he developed R flank pain. States he had intense pain on urination and noticed that his urine had blood in it. States the pain has been constant since it began and was only partially relieved by dilaudid which he received in the ED. States it is sharp in nature and is equally as strong if he lies still vs. moving around. . Pt states around :p.m. on the DOA he also developed chest pain while he was sitting watching t.v. States it was an located in the center of his chest and radiated to his L jaw, L neck, and L arm. States he also had SOB, nausea, and diaphoresis. Took SL nitro's and the pain decreased to a . He presented to the and was subsequently transferred to the for cath. However, given his history of allergy to aspirin (states he gets SOB and his whole body swells he was transferred to the CCU for asa desensitization prior to cath. On ROS pt denies any recent vomiting, diarrhea, BRBPR, melena. No fevers, chills, night sweats or changes in weight. States legs occasionally get swollen but this has not occurred lately. States at baseline he can only walk a short distance before getting SOB. Sleeps on one pillow and denies any PND or orthopnea. . On review of the online records from the , and Mt. , it was found that the patient has had admissions in the past months for these exact same sx's. Each admission makes note of a completely negative workup including negative cardiac enzymes, no ECG changes, and CT scans which show no evidence of nephrolithiasis. His last admission documents malingering in which the patient was found cutting his hand and placing drops of blood in his urine and then denying this act later. All four admissions document his dilaudid seeking behavior, and in the most recent admission to on , he left AMA after he was refused dilaudid and offered only po or IM.

However, later he disclosed that his wife left him for another man in and took their children with her. States he lives alone and has little social support. He used to work as a commercial fisherman and as licensed auto mechanic, however he stopped working in s/p his ICD pacemaker placement. Last year he started receiving disability benefits.

Brief Hospital Course: A/P: yo M with history of HTN, CAD, CHF with EF of %, s/p ICD pacemaker in for VT, and biploar, who presents with chest pain and R lower flank pain. This is at least the pt's th admission for these two symptoms in the past months; all of these admissions have resulted in negative workups and all have been dominated by the pt's dilaudid-seeking behavior. . Cardiac: . CAD: The pt's description of chest pain was concerning for ACS, however, since the pt had presented at least times in the past months with this exact same description and on this admission he had negative enzymes with no ECG changes, it was considered unlikely that this pain was cardiac. The mm ST depressions seen in V- have been present in the past on some ECG's. Thus, it was determined that a catheterization was not necessary. The pt underwent a pMIBI stress test which showed no reversible perfusion defects. The pt was continued on plavix, BB and was started on an ACEi. He also underwent aspirin desensitization successfully and was started on ASA daily. His atorvastatin was increased to mg daily given his CAD and multiple risk factors. . .

R flank pain with questionable hematuria: pt gives h/o nephrolithiasis, however, has had CT's in the past months which have all been negative. Pt was observed during last admission to have cut his hand and squeezed the blood into his urine cup. His Ua on this admission was negative for blood. He underwent a CT which showed no evidence of nephrolithiasis or secondary signs to suggest obstruction. His Cr on admission was . and subsequently increased to ., however, the pt appeared dry and his UOP was low. He was hydrated withF and repeat Cr was .. Urology signed off and stated there were no GU issues. However, the pt continued to complain of R flank pain and stated that he had been having this pain for several months and the only thing that had ever helped it was dilaudid. When he was told that he would not be receiving dilaudid he stated that he was ready to go home and insisted on speedy arrangements of transportation. . Psych/bipolar disorder: Pt was continued on depakote, trazodone, and zoloft. He was seen by social work who provided support given that his wife recently left him, leaving him alone in his apartment. He denied any suicidal ideations and was deemed safe for discharge. He was urged to follow up with his outpatient psychiatrist as soon as possible. . Pain: pt reported severe pain, but was able to move very easily. He stated he had pain in his R flank that was worse withbulation, however, he was repeatedly seen wandering the halls in search of food in the patient kitchen. He was treated with his outpatient dose of Oxycontin mg and was given IM and po dilaudid mg q hours prn. On discharge he requested vicodin, stating that he was trying to get off of his oxycontin. This medication was declined and the pt was urged to find a PCP who could assist him with getting off of his oxycontin gradually over time after they have arranged a contract verifying that the pt will not pursue other narcotics from other providers.

Given the results of your tests, your chest pain is not likely cardiac in nature and so going from hospital to hospital with this complaint is more likely to put you at increased danger due to unnecessary tests. Similarly, there is no evidence of kidney stones so pursuing more imaging tests would not likely be useful. What is most likely to help is to find a PCP and address your concerns with this doctor who will follow you over the long-term. Followup Instructions: Please find a PCP .

The patient has had no previous history of coronary artery disease, nor any angina. He does not see a doctor on a regular basis. He has no associated nausea or vomiting. Pain reoccurred on , and daughter called . The patient was sent to Hospital and started on Nitroglycerin, Morphine Sulfate, Aggrastat and given mg of Plavix. The patient was then transferred emergently to for emergent catheterization after a positive stress test. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Nephrolithiasis. MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Potassium Citrate. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. Coronary catheterization shows an ejection fraction of %, wedge pressure of , left ventricular end diastolic pressure to , % left main, % left anterior descending, % obtuse marginal, left to right collaterals. Pertinent laboratories include a CK MB of and troponin in the range. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient denies any chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, no edema. No history of transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular accident. No dysphasia. No claudication. No gastrointestinal bleeding. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is afebrile and vital signs are stable. He is awake, alert and oriented times three. The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. He is neurologically intact grossly. His heart is regular rate and rhythm with a/VI systolic ejection murmur. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally. The abdomen is flat, soft, nontender, nondistended, with audible bowel sounds. The patient had a palpable left femoral pulse, bilateral popliteals, bilateral dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses and bilateral radial pulses. He had an intra-aortic balloon pump in his right femoral artery. Carotids had no bruits. Lower extremities showed no varicosities. He was without cyanosis, clubbing or edema. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient spent the next two days on the CCU service receiving medical management as well as all his preoperative testing. On , the patient was taken to the Operating Room where a coronary artery bypass graft was performed with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to the ramus and saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal. Postoperatively, the patient was a number of drips including Neo-Synephrine, Milrinone and Amiodarone for intraoperative atrial fibrillation. While in the unit, the patient had a number of episodes of atrial fibrillation which were poorly tolerated hemodynamically. For that reason, the patient was cardioverted a number of times. A postoperative transesophageal echocardiogram was performed showing a left ventricular ejection fraction of %. The patient was heparinized for his atrial fibrillation. He was also placed on Plavix due to poor bypass targets. Over the course of his stay in the unit, the patient's pressors were slowly weaned. His intra-aortic balloon pump and chest tubes were removed at the appropriate time. The pacing wires were removed at appropriate time. He was started on beta blockade when it was felt that he would tolerate it. He was also diuresed using Lasix and placed on Captopril for afterload control. Electrophysiology was consulted and was extensively included in the care of the patient, in particular, his atrial fibrillation. After his initial Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient no longer had any hemodynamic compromise from his atrial fibrillation. On postoperative day six, the patient fell getting out of bed as he was unstable on his feet and confused. After the fall, he did not have any sequelae. He did not hit his head. He did not have any change of mental status as a result of the fall. The patient was, however, closely monitored for any neurological changes. When the time was right, the patient was sent to the floor. He was given contact with physical therapy and case management. It was initially the plan to send the patient to a rehabilitation facility, however, the length of time that it took to get the patient therapeutic on Coumadin and off his Heparin, as well as a newly developing cellulitis at his vein donor site, lengthened the patient's stay in the hospital, allowing him to become more independent from a physical standpoint. As noted, the patient did develop erythema of his donor site. He was initially started on Kefzol with little improvement in the developing cellulitis. After a couple days of treatment with Kefzol, the patient had Clindamycin added to his antibiotic regimen which did cause a decrease in erythema and improvement in his cellulitis. It is now , and the patient is being discharged home in good condition. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: He is being sent home with a number of medications including: . Clarithromycin mg p.o. twice a day times ten days. . Keflex mg p.o. qhours for ten days. . Lasix mg p.o. once daily for seven days. . Amiodarone mg p.o. once daily. . Captopril mg p.o. three times a day. . Aspirin mg p.o. once daily. . Lopressor mg p.o. three times a day. . Atorvastatin mg p.o. once daily. . Plavix mg p.o. once daily. . Colace mg p.o. once daily. He is not being sent home at this time with a prescription for Coumadin as his INR is at the higher end of therapeutic in the past couple days of dosing. It is the opinion that his INR will continue to increase higher than we wish. For that reason, the patient was instructed and I have spoken with the patient's wife over the telephone this evening to reiterate the patient is to contact the cardiothoracic team on morning regarding organizing blood draws and receiving a prescription for further Coumadin treatment. She was also informed regarding the importance of receiving a primary care physician for the patient.

The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Brief Hospital Course: year old woman with history of multiple sclerosis, SLE c/b nephritis presenting with altered mental status found to be in shock complicated by multi-organ failure. . Septic shock: serratia bacteremia presumably from GI source given pancolitis on CT abdomen/pelvis. Shock requiring max dose pressors on presentation and she was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids until blood cultures grew serratia bacteremia. Also cardiogenic in setting of sepsis as EF was severely depressed on initial echo obtained upon presentation to the ED (since normalized s/p treatment of sepsis. Serratia was initially covered with cefepime which was then changed to ciprofloxacin given sensitivities as per recs. She completed a full week course of the above antibiotics with resolution of her shock and discontinuation of pressor support. Of note, she also grew serratia from right leg deep tissue biopsy (performed by surgery on presentation, but suspect leg was seeded from blood as opposed to leg as source of bacteremia. CT right LE was negative for fluid collection/abscess/air. At the time of discharge, her BP was stable, she was afebrile, and there was no leukocytosis. . Livedo necrosis: Right lower extremity biopsied on initial presentation out of concern for necrotizing fasciitis and source of sepsis. General surgery and dermatology were consulted and deep tissue biopsy did not show e/o nec fasciitis however did also grow serratia to lesser degree than in blood. CT right lower extremity was unrevealing for abscess and air was leg was presumably seeded from bacteremia as opposed to leg as source. Aggressive wound care was performed daily. She will need follow up with Dr. (surgery as outpt. for wounds (ph . Will need wound care per wound care recommendations. . Fungemia: albicans grew from blood cultures presumably from line source as initial cultures were drawn from tunnelled line. She was started on caspofungin pending sensitivities and tunnelled, PICC and A-line were all discontinued. Surveillance cultures were monitored without subsequent growth after initial positive. Caspofungin was then changed to fluconazole as it was sensitive and she completed a week course from date of first negative blood culture. . RIJ/Rt brachial DVT: Developed in the setting of right sided tunnelled line. She was started on heparin gtt and tunnelled line was discontinued. She was started on coumadin, and the heparin gtt until INR . goal PTT should be between -. . Anemia/hct drop: Has baseline anemia from underlying renal dz and renal failure however now with acute drop while on heparin gtt. She did have bloody oral secretions but not enough to lose thatount of blood (.-->. She has had no gross blood per GI tract however concerning is the increase in her BUN. No other clear source of blood loss. Prior to discharge, she had some frank blood from her tracheostomy, and heparin gtt was stopped. Her HCT remained stable. Repeat bronchoscopy did not show any areas of frank bleeding, and it was thought to be secondary to trauma from the tube. Heparin was stopped for days, and then restarted without incident. Her HCT remained stable. . Respiratory failure: Initially intubated on presentation in the setting of altered mental status. She was extubated, however failed and was reintubated due to profound respiratory muscle weakness, copious oral secretions and inability to clear them. She was again extubated however had probable aspiration event with acute hypoxia and brdaycardia again requiring reintubation. given her prolonged intubation, she was trached and a PEG was placed by interventional pulmonology. She tolerated this well, and at the time of discharge, she was on a tracheosty mask at % FiO. The tracheostomy tube was replaced with a shorter tube on the day of discharge. . Acute renal failure/Lupus nephritis: patient had rising Cr thought to be lupus nephritis prior to this admission. She became oliguric on admisison requiring initiation of CVVH which she tolerated well and was transitioned to HD. In the setting of fungemia, however, her tunnelled line was discontinued and her UOP continued to improve. Her cellcept was held on presentation and briefly restarted before again being held in the setting of fungemia. Stress dose steroids were initiated on presentation and hydrocortisone was subsequently titrated down to prednisone mg daily and she was discharged on cellcept mg qid. She should also receive epogen per her regular schedule and follow up with her nephrologist. . Oral ulcers: During her course, she developed severe oral ulcers involving her lips and within the oropharynx. HSV was cultured from lip ulcers and she was started on valtrex for a - day course. Topical viscous lidocaine was used for pain control. She is currently on a prophylactic dose of valtrex. . Pancytopenia: Leukopenia on presentation secondary to sepsis/DIC vs. due to lupus vs. in setting of cellcept. Her cellcept was held and her sepsis was treated and her WBC count and hct improved. Platelet recovery lagged however improved to the K range where they remained stable. . SLE: With lupus nephritis as above. Off cellcept temporarily given fungemia and on hydrocortisone. She was discharged on prednisone mg qdaily and cellcept qid. . MS: Stable without active issues. . nutrition: A PEG tube was placed and she tolerated tube feeds. She was started on an oral diet after a speech and swallow evaluation. When she has adequate nutritional intake by mouth her tubefeeds can be weaned. She had some discomfort surrounding her PEG tube and was evaluated several times by interventional pulmonology and no problems were found. This is likely due to pain at the surgical site. . hypertension: maintained with good blood pressure control on his current medications.

As this cluster of cells is present on another level, it is present in the tissue block. Given the apparent lack of a history of neoplasia, as well as the appearance of this cluster of cells on the slide, it is favored to be a contaminant from another case. (Discussed with Pathology and felt to be a contaminant from another sample. C Vertebral body : results pending at time of discharge IMAGING: CT C-spine witho contrast: Laminectomy changes at C-C with osseous destructive process centered around the C-C intervertebral disc space concerning for vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis. MRI C-spine is recommended for further evaluation. CXR : Substantial cardiomegaly. No evidence of acute disease. MR with and witho contrast : . No significant changes are demonstrated since the prior examinations, persistent abnormal signal identified at C/C level, with moderate pattern of enhancement and retropulsion. . Kyphotic deformity at C/C level, causing anterior thecal sac deformity, these findings are concerning for discitis, osteomyelitis. Epidural thickening with moderate pattern of enhancement, likely consistent with a combination of prominent epidural veins and dural thickening, no frank evidence of epidural collection is identified. Unchanged prevertebral soft tissue swelling extending from C through C levels. . Multilevel degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine as described above. There is no evidence of focal or diffuse lesions within the cervical spinal cord; however, the examination is limited due to patient motion. MRI Brain : . No acute intracranial process, specifically no evidence of intracranial infection or infarction. . Mild chronic small vessel ischemic disease. . A lesion which lies superiorly to the right parotid is likely an enlarged lymph nodes, although a parotid tumor cannot be excluded. Could correlate clinically and with prior imaging studies. . No stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm visualized within the cerebral vasculature. TTE : The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The LV ejection fraction appears depressed (? percent. There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm. The right ventricle also appears hypokinetic. The aortic valve leaflets ( are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (+ mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Bilateral lower extremity ulratsound : Limited assessment of the peroneal veins bilaterally, otherwise no evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower extremities. CXR : As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a cervical fusion. The endotracheal tube has been removed, the nasogastric tube is also removed, but the right PICC line remains in unchanged position. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with small areas of atelectasis but no evidence of pneumonia or other pathological changes. No pneumothorax. Brief Hospital Course: M with Afib on Coumadin, CHF with EF %, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, multiple DVTs and PEs, HTN, cervical spinal stenosis s/p C-C laminectomies and C-C fusion c/b MSSA wound infection, who was transferred from with - days of increased neck pain, R sided weakness, with imaging evidence of C-C discitis/osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis: Patient with history of cervical spinal stenosis s/p C-C laminectomies and C-C fusion c/b MSSA wound infection that required prolonged antibiotics. He was admitted with increased neck pain, R sided weakness, and with imaging evidence on CT C-spine of C-C discitis/osteomyelitis. Was seen by Ortho-Spine in the ED and placed in a J cervical collar due to his unstable C-spine. He was afebrile, without leukocytosis, and numerous blood cultures were negative. Antibiotics were initially held per consult while awaiting cultures, and given the clinical stability of the patient from an infectious standpoint. MRI with and without contrast was obtained on third attempt, requiring general anesthesia due to patient discomfort in the scanner and motion artifacts. MRI/MRA of the brain revealed no evidence of intracranial pathology, including septic emboli. TTE showed no evidence of endocarditis, and TEE was not obtained due to low suspicion of endocarditis. Origin of the infection was not clear, possibly related to the prior MSSA infection in . History, physical, and work-up revealed no other infectious source that could have led to the osteomyelitis. Due to the proximity of the infection to the carotids, Neuro IR decided they would not be able to obtain an IR-guided biopsy. Thus, the patient needed an operative biopsy, which was delayed due to the patient's Afib with RVR and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (discussed below. . His first procedure was an anterior stabilization and operative biopsy, involving C- corpectomies and anterior C-T fusion on . The procedure went well. He was left intubated following the procedure, and required brief MICU admission notable for hypotension and Afib with RVR. His heparin gtt was restarted hours after the surgery, and the patient was kept in the MICU for the first day after restarting the heparin for frequent neuro checks, as there was concern for high risk of bleeding post-operatively. He did not develop any new neurologic deficits, and was stable for transfer back to the medicine floor. Cultures from the biopsy were negative, and pathology from C vertebral body biopsy revealed no definitive evidence of osteomyelitis. The patient received cefazolin peri-operatively, and was continued on this antibiotic after the surgery. However, after cultures remained negative, consult recommended again holding antibiotics and obtaining repeat cultures when the patient went back to the OR on for posterior stabilization. The patient underwent deep bone biopsy, open treatment cervical fracture/dislocation, posterior cervical arthrodesis C-C, C-C, posterior thoracic arthrodesis C-T, posterior instrumentation C-T, iliac crest bone graft harvest for fusion, and allograft for fusion on . Again, he tolerated the procedure well. Was again briefly admitted to MICU post-op, but stable for transfer to the floor the following day. Patient was placed back on cefazolin perioperatively, though cultures from the repeat biopsy also remained negative. Universal PCR for bacterial and fungal pathogens was sent, and was negative. Given increasingly low suspicion for active infection, recommended stopping all antibiotics on . They will see patient in follow-up in several weeks, and will monitor CBC, ESR, and CRP at the -week and -week marks. With regard to the patient's cervical spine stability, he will wear the J collar until Ortho-Spine follow-up in weeks. His pain was controlled during the admission with acetaminophen, gabapentin, tramadol, methadone, and oxycodone prn pain. He was placed on a dilaudid PCA post-operatively. Home tizanadine was used to help control muscle spasms. Of note, his ECG was monitored for QTc prolongation with patient on both methadone and tizanadine. He worked with PT/OT, and acute rehab was recommended. Atrial fibrillation: The patient was on warfarin for anticoagulation, and carvedilol for rate control prior to admission. He had initial bursts of RVR on arrival to the floor, which improved with his home carvedilol. After MRI obtained under general anesthesia, the patient was transferred to the MICU in the setting of Afib with RVR with rates in s-s and SBPs s-. He received metoprolol mg without response in the PACU. His CXR showed question of RML atelectasis; no signs of pulmonary edema or obvious infiltrate. EKG c/w Afib with RVR but no signs of ischemia. In the MICU, the patient was started on a diltiazem drip with good control of heart rate, and the patient was started on PO metoprolol. He briefly required pressors. His carvedilol was d/c-ed in order to reduce alpha blockade in setting of relative hypotension. was weaned off dilt gtt with good control of heart rate on metoprolol mg T and SBP>. After transfer back to the floor from the MICU, he maintained good HR control on this dose of metoprolol. Following his first surgery, C- corpectomies and anterior C-T fusion, the patient was again transferred to the MICU for Afib with RVR and hypotension with SBP in the s. He received fluids and dilt drip, resulting in good rate control. He was successfully extubated and rate control was transitioned to metoprolol mg T with SBP>. After transfer back to the floor from the MICU, he maintained good HR control on metoprolol, though dose was increased to .mg T prior to discharge. . Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome/Anticoagulation management: Patient has history of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, RUE DVT, and PEx. INR was supratherapeutic on arrival to the hospital. Coumadin and aspirin were held given his supratherapeutic INR, and pending surgical procedures. Heme/onc was for assistance with anticoagulation management peri-operatively. He was maintained on heparin drip initially. INR was reversed with vitamin K and FFP. Due to the need to be off of anticoagulation peri-operatively for his spine surgeries, a temporaryC filter was placed by IR on . Heparin drip remained off hours before and hours after the surgery on . After the first procedure, the patient was monitored with frequent neurologic exam checks, especially after resuming therapeutic anticoagulation. Heparin drip was continued with goal PTT - between his two C-spine surgeries. His INR trended up despite not receiving Coumadin, and he received additional vitamin K prior to his second C-spine procedure. Heparin drip was again discontinued before the second surgery, and restarted after the second procedure. After the second procedure, the patient was again monitored with neurologic exam checks, especially after resuming therapeutic anticoagulation. HisC filter was removed on , and his warfarin was resumed that same day. He should continue on the heparin gtt until INR has been therapeutic at - for > hours. INR was . on day of discharge, and warfarin was held. If INR therapeutic on , heparin gtt can be discontinued. Would recommend restarting warfarin at mg daily once INR <. Chronic sCHF: Prior EF documented as -%; TEE this admission revealed EF %. Patient did not have any evidence of exacerbation this admission. He was initially continued on home medications, but later in his course his furosemide/lisinopril were held in the setting of hypotension due to Afib with RVR and narcotics use. These medications can be restarted as BP will allow in the outpatient setting. At this time, will plan to restart furosemide on discharge. Of note, as above his beta blocker was switched from carvedilol to metoprolol this admission for better HR control. . HTN: BP remained well controlled during admission, with occasional episodes of lower SBP in the s-s. These lower pressures were attributed to narcotics use, and occasionally occurred in the setting of Afib with RVR. Patient was asymptomatic. In this setting, his home carvedilol was changed to metoprolol, which was uptitrated to a dose of .mg T prior to discharge. His home lisinopril can be started back following discharge if BP remains stable. Furosemide will be restarted on discharge. . Depression: Continued sertraline. . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Given low suspicion for active infection, patient will not be discharged on antibiotics. -Patient needs CBC, ESR, and CRP checked at weeks and weeks, with results sent to clinic. follow-up scheduled for . -Patient has Ortho follow-up with Dr. scheduled for , though this appointment may be moved. Should wear J collar until that time. -Patient restarted on warfarin . Please monitor INR daily and adjust warfarin dose accordingly. Please continue heparin gtt with goal PTT - until INR therapeutic ( for > hours. If INR therapeutic on , can d/c heparin. As INR . on day of discharge, would recommend continuing to monitor INR and restarting at mg daily once INR <. -Please continue to reassess pain and increase/taper narcotic regimen as needed. Patient may benefit from a pain consult after discharge if narcotics requirements continue to be an issue. -Patient's lasix and lisinopril held this admission given relatively lower BP (s-s and that patient appeared euvolemic. Can be restarted in outpt setting as tolerated, and would recommend restarting lasix at this time. -MRI during admission revealed enlarged lymph node superior to right parotid gland (though differential includes Warthin's tumor or adenoma. Should be compared to prior imaging and followed up after discharge. -On pathology report of C vertebral body biopsy, note was made of a detached cluster of neoplastic cells, favored to be neoplastic epithelial cells.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair. Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. , You were admitted to the hospital for neck pain and right-sided weakness. CT and MRI scans of your neck were obtained. There was concern for an infection in the bones in your neck (osteomyelitis, and the Orthopedic-Spine and Infectious Disease doctors . You underwent surgery two times (one procedure done from the front of the neck and one from the back of the neck with the Orthopedic doctors your neck and hopefully to prevent further pain and weakness. We did cultures of your blood and of the bone removed from your neck, which revealed no evidence of infection. You received antibiotics after the spine procedures, but the Infectious Disease doctors not feel you need to continue on antibiotics after you leave the hospital. You received pain medication, and you worked with physical therapy to start regaining your strength and mobility. Because of your history of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and multiple prior blood clots, we the Hematology doctors to help manage your anticoagulation. Your INR was high on admission and too high for surgery, so we stopped your coumadin and reversed your anticoagulation. You received heparin while the coumadin was stopped. You also had an inferior vena cava (IVC filter placed prior to the spine procedures, due to the need to stop the heparin temporarily for the procedures. The inferior vena cava filter was removed after your two spine procedures. After all of these procedures, we re-started your coumadin. You will take coumadin after discharge. With regard to your atrial fibrillation, your heart rate was high on several occasions. This improved with changing your rate control medications, intravenous fluids, and better pain control. Due to your lower blood pressure, we held your furosemide and lisinopril while you were here. You should discuss restarting these medications with your doctor after you leave the hospital, but it is reasonable to restart your furosemide (lasix at this time. We made the following changes to your medications: - STOPPED carvedilol (coreg - STOPPED lisinopril -CHANGED gabapentin dose (Neurontin -CHANGED methadone dosing -CHANGED warfarin dosing -STARTED metprolol (for heart rate control -STARTED senna and bisacodyl as needed for constipation -STARTED miconazole powder as needed for skin irritation -STARTED heparin (until your INR is at the right level -STARTED oxycodone mg every four hours as needed for pain (with an additional mg twice daily as needed for breakthrough pain when working with PT We did not make any other changes to your medications. Please continue to take them as you have been doing. Please discuss with your doctor whether you should be taking aspirin (this medication was on your medication list, but you do not recall taking it recently.

Pleural effusion, if any, is minimal. The upper esophagus is mildly distended with air. CT Chest: Newly developed areas of ground-glass opacities in addition to areas of chronic subpleural minimal interstitial chronic changes. The chronic interstitial abnormalities are most likely consistent with NSIP. The rapid development in last two weeks of the diffuse homogeneous ground glass opacities in combination with severe hypoxia and radiological appearance of the findings are highly concerning for several possibilities: acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease, infection (for example opportunistic infection, acute interstitial pneumonia, hypersensitivity reaction to a new drug/ and less likely hemorrhage.

Dyspnea/hypoxia: This patient had multiple potential causes of dyspnea including ILD/NSIP, potential cardiac causes (CHF, CAD, Afib s/p recent ablation - potential for pulmonary vein stenosis, ?history of PFO - potential for shunt, and pulmonary artery hypertension. He was also thought to have component of chronic dyspnea unrelated to ILD, with a significant hyperventilatory response to exercise. Pulmonary vein stenosis was considered in light of recent ablation, but thought by cardiology to be unlikely after imaging pre and post ablation was reviewed with radiology. Instead, they felt that pulmonary contusion as sequelae of ablation was possible explanation. .

In general he was an ill appearing overweight male in no acute distress, sedated and intubated. HEENT examination: Pupils equal, round and reactive to light. Mucous membranes moist. Cardiac examination: Regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops. Normal S and S. Pulmonary examination: Clear to auscultation bilaterally posteriorly. Abdomen was soft, distended, with normoactive bowel sounds, nontender to palpation. Extremities with two plus bilateral lower extremity edema up to the knee. Neurological examination: Unable to assess secondary to sedation. LABORATORY DATA: From the outside hospital, CBC revealed a white blood cell count of . with a hematocrit of and platelet count of . Chem- revealed a sodium of , potassium of ., chloride was ; bicarbonate , BUN , creatinine . and serum glucose was . Calcium was . and magnesium was .. CK was with an MB fraction of . and troponin T of .. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at with a normal axis and normal intervals. There were no ST changes, T wave inversions or Q waves. Chest-ray showed increased right atrial contour with a dilated pulmonary artery, right greater than left. ET tube was well placed. There was no evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia. HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: . RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: The patient underwent bronchoscopy with BAL on the morning following admission. Copious secretions were suctioned including an obstructing plug at the left main stem bronchus. Initially, it was felt that mucous plugging was the cause of the patient's respiratory decline, however, the patient continued to have a high FIO requirement despite aggressive suctioning. The patient was continued on Levofloxacin which was begun at an outside hospital for possible tracheobronchitis. His initial BAL was negative for any organisms. He was also treated for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with intravenous steroids,Is and high dose guaifenesin. The patient was initially on pressure control ventilation and was eventually able to be weaned to pressure support. With weaning of his sedation, he was able to tolerate a spontaneous breathing trial and on , he was successfully extubated. Of note, he did continue to have significant wheezing peri extubation. Discussions will be forthcoming with the Interventional Pulmonary Team as well as with Thoracic Surgery regarding possible tracheal reconstruction, however, at this time, he will continue to have the stents in place. . HYPERTENSION: The patient had no prior history of high blood pressure, however, he was noted to have elevated blood pressures during his Intensive Care Unit course. An echocardiogram was obtained, however, due to the patient's body habitus, poor windows were obtained. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of systolic dysfunction. He was started on hydrochlorothiazide and Captopril for control of his blood pressure with good response. . DIABETES MELLITUS: The patient had elevated blood sugars throughout his Intensive Care Unit course which was felt to be in part due to high dose steroids. For the initial portion of his admission, he was maintained on an insulin drip. On , he was transitioned to Lantus and a Regular insulin sliding scale. . GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE: The patient was maintained on a twice a day proton pump inhibitor. . TACHYCARDIA / CHEST PAIN: Per report, the patient had complaint of chest pain prior to his transfer to . Of note, he did have an outpatient stress test prior to this admission which showed an equivocal reversible wall motion abnormality. He was ruled out for myocardial infarction on presentation with negative cardiac enzymes times three. An EKG was checked and it did not show any evidence of ischemia. As stated above, he was started on anti-hypertensives and echocardiogram was obtained. . FLU, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: The patient was on tube feeds while he was intubated. He tolerated these well. . SEDATION: The patient was initially very agitated and dyssynchronous with the ventilator. He required high doses of propofol and Versed to achieve adequate sedation. He was eventually weaned off of both with the addition of scheduled Haldol. At the time of this dictation, he is off both Propofol and Haldol and receiving scheduled doses of Haldol and Ativan. The remainder of this dictation will be completed by the next house officer to assume the patient's care.
