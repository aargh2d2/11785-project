Overall she improved, but continued to have stool drainage and nausea. A new fluid collection developed in the right abdomen. A percutaneous drain was placed and symptoms improved. A low residue diet was attempted but patient continued to have vomiting and therefore returned to OR for ostomy for stool diversion. Pt was followed by general surgery after ileostomy for managment of her abdominal wound dressings including a vac dressing. An alloderm closure was attempted on . Abdominal fistulas with drainage of feculent material devloped on POD. Necrotic tissue on the wound was noted. The alloderm closure had multiple defects. A modified low suction vacuum dressing was applied with occlusive dressing to aid in keeping wound area clean from fecal drainage. No overt signs of sepsis (hemodynamically stable, WBC stable, low grade fever only, blood culture NGTD. However, given multiple fistulas and no effective surgical/medical management, hospice services were offered and palliative care consult obtained. She was tolerating fluids at time of discharge. TPN was discontinued given wishes for hospice care. GU: Initially elevated creatinine returned to baseline level of . by POD. Peritoneal fluid collection developed near urostomy site (see above. Loopogram and repeated creatinine levels of drained fluid were not consistent with a urostomy leak. Urology followed patient throughout her hospital course. Ileal conduit continues to work well. : Patient received levofloxacin and metronidazole for empiric coverage in setting of rectal anastomotic leak. She had several courses of levofloxacin/flagyl but this was discontinued completely on . Vancomycin was started on for enterococcus in fluid from abdomen and increased WBC.

ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND : IMPRESSION: The constellation of cholelithiasis, peri-pancreatic fluid, and lab evidence of pancreatitis is consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS : . Diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with areas of hypodensity that could represent pseudocysts, although these are not well delineated given lack of contrast. Note that a pancreatic mass cannot be excluded. There are several focal fluid collections, likely representing pseudocysts, including within the gastrohepatic ligament, left upper quadrant, and likely splenic subcapsular. There is small abdominal and moderate pelvic ascites. There is apparent thickening of the distal stomach/proximal duodenum, with apparent mass effect from the pancreatic head enlargement. . Cholelithiasis. . Cecal and proximal ascending colonic thickening, which may be infectious or inflammatory, but ischemia cannot be excluded. . Large left pleural effusion and left lower lobe collapse. Small right pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. ECHO : No atrial septal defect is seen by D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>%. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets ( are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLERS : . Left distal popliteal vein DVT. Left posterior tibial vein showed decreased flow consistent with thrombus. . Right and left calf veins not clearly evaluated. Brief Hospital Course: year-old woman presents with gallstone pancreatitis with peripancreatic fluid with concomitant pleural effusion which is likely an extension of abdominal cavity fluid. Other active issues that the patient presented with are acute renal failure, LLE DVT, and abnormal UPEP. hospital course: The patient arrived in respiratory distress and hypoxic CHF and pleural effusion. A thoracentesis was performed on and one liter of transudative fluid was aspirated. She was placed on Vanco, Cefepime, and Flagyl to cover both pneumonia and cholangitis. ERCP consult was obtained and deferred EUS or ERCP until clinical status improved. Pancreatitis was treated conservatively. CT scan performed and noted that her CBD was dilated, question if this is post-obstructive changes. Patient also had truncal rash that was non pruritic, drug rash-like, but there is not a clear offending medication. This was followed conservatively. Acute renal failure did not resolve after hydration, renal was consulted and followed noted that this is ATN with uric acid crystals. SPEP noted to have possible polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. UPEP showed heavy chain bands, so heme-onc was consulted. LLE DVT found and heparin gtt started. Post-pyloric feeding tube was placed because of pancreatitis. The patient was stable for transfer to the floor. After being transferred to the floor, she became tachypneic, tachycardic with mild hypotension and thus was transferred to the trauma ICU. This was thought to be due to PE for which she was treated with a heparin gtt. She was intubated on and cardioverted for rapid afib and started on pressors. She remained in the TSICU for the remainder of her stay. She was intubated and sedated. She required pressors for hypotension andiodarone for paroxysmal afib. She continued to have a significant vent requirement with high peep due to pulmonary edema. She receieved a trach on . She had a dobhoff tube placed and was fed enterally. She had CVVH until due to continued renal failure. She was maintained on a heparin gtt for DVT. She got anC filter placed on . She was maintained on multiple abx: aztreonam for pna, flagyl for empiric cdiff, and fluconazole. The patient was relatively stable at the end of her hospitalization, but due to her significant illness and vent dependence and poor prognosis, she made the decision to come off of ventilator support on . She later died of respiratory arrest early on the morning of . PROBLEM LIST: . Gallstone pancreatitis without abdominal pain: Post-pyloric feeding tube removed when patient demonstrated that she could eat orally without problem. ERCP service considered EUS to evaluate the pancreas parenchyma or ERCP to evaluate for retained gallstones but the patient was not clinically stable enough to undergo these procedures. The patient underwent IR placement of pseudocyst drain on which returned approx cc of fluid. This fluid was sent for culture though nothing grew. . Shortness of breath CHF, pleural effusion, and possible pneumonia. On antibiotics for pneumonia. As needed lasix for CHF. S/p liter aspiration of pleural effusion on . Pleural effusion likely to reaccumulate since thoracentesis. Therapeutic thoracentesis as indicated. Cytology on pleural fluid was negative for malignancy. Patient reintubated on and ultimately underwent bedside tracheostomy. She was unable to be weaned from the vent. The patient persistently indicated and stated her desire to not be on the vent, even if it meant that she would die from respiratory failure. The patient was deamed competent to make that decision, and the vent was turned off on the night of . The patient passed away from respiratory failure at : on . . Acute kidney injury non-oliguric ATN, likely secondary to pancreatitis. Renal service was consulted. She was started on CVVH in the TSICU due to uremia and acidosis. . Abnormal UPEP: Heme-onc performed bone marrow biopsy on . . LLE DVT: Heparin gtt . Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine . DNR/DNI: Confirmed with the patient and healthcare proxy, (pt's daughter. After the patient underwent a tracheostomy and was able to communicate, it became apparent that the patient did not wish to continue her life on a ventilator in the ICU. Multiple family meetings were held during which it was decided that the patient was competent to make her own decisions regarding what interventions she wanted. The patient decided that she did not want to be on a ventilator, even if to be off the ventilator would lead to imminent respiratory arrest. On the patient was made CMO based on her own wishes, and the family was present and agreed.

Respiratory distress syndrome . Sepsis . Patent ductus arteriosis . Hypotension . Hyperbilirubinemia HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: . Respiratory: The infant initially was being bagged at high settings and was still at an oxygen saturation of mid-s. The decision to change the baby to high-frequency oscillating ventilation was made, and his initial settings were MAP of .,plitude of , and FIO came down to %. The infant was given surfactant , and was continued on high-frequency until , at which point he was changed to conventional ventilation at pressures of , PEEP of , rate of . Over the weekend of , he had numerous desaturations and required more support, necessitating going back onto high-frequency oscillating ventilation. He was subsequently switched back to conventional ventilation on , and tolerated the switch back to conventional ventilation without any difficulties. His chest-ray shows some streaky opacities with intermittent collapse of the right upper lobe dependent on endotracheal tube placement. . Cardiovascular: The infant was significantly hypotensive starting from birth. He received normal saline boluses and subsequently was started on dopamine. His dopamine was as high as on . He was also started on an epinephrine drip on day of life two, which was subsequently weaned off over several days. His dopamine remained on until . He also was started on hydrocortisone within the first hours of life. He received hydrocortisone . mg/kg intravenously every hours . He was started on Indocin for a presumed patent ductus arteriosis within the first hours of life. He received one course of Indocin. Subsequently, on , he had an echocardiogram for potential reopening of the duct, at which point the echocardiogram revealed no evidence of patent ductus arteriosis. . Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: Parenteral nutrition was started on day of life one. By day of life two, his fluids were at cc/kg/day. He subsequently reached a maximum of total fluids of cc/kg/day when his sodium climbed to . By the second week of life, his total fluids were down to , and he started on trophic feeds. His electrolytes by day were sodium of , potassium ., chloride , bicarbonate , BUN , creatinine ., and glucose . Subsequently his glucose rose to a high of above , however, he was not spilling glucose in his urine, and it subsequently came down to . The reason his trophic enteral feeds were delayed for the first two weeks of life was due to his critical status and his Indocin courses , and his subsequent necessity for a Broviac line. . Infectious Disease: His initial CBC had a white count of . with an I to T ratio of .. His platelets at this time were . He received a full seven day course ofpicillin and gentamicin. On the weekend of the , when he was changed back over to high-frequency oscillating ventilation and clinically was not doing well, he was believed to be septic and was started on vancomycin and gentamicin. He received several days extended through the placement of his Broviac, however, hours after Broviac placement, his antibiotics were discontinued. All of his blood cultures have remained no growth to date. . Hematology: The infant got transfused multiple times with packed red blood cells for a hematocrit as low as . His last hematocrit was . at approximately day of life . . Neurology: The infant has received two head ultrasounds within the first few days of life, both of which were normal, noH. He was started on a fentanyl drip and it reached a high of mcg/kg/hour. By the second week of life, it was decreased down to ., and subsequently was being weaned again. . Surgery: On , the infant underwent placement of a central venous line. Indication was for access for long-term nutrition.

NEUROLOGIC: Cause of status epilepticus most likely secondary to noncompliance with medications as valproic acid level was subtherapeutic at on admission. Also, given frequency of seizures, his regimen of valproic acid mg qid was likely not adequate as a single . No electrolyte abnormality was present. Alcohol W/D versus intoxication is also on the differential. Head CT was witho acute process. He was continued on home dose of Depakote and also started on Dilantin initially. Patient was successfully extubated on . He did say that he was on Depakote mg qid at home. Has also been on Dilantin in the past which gave him headaches and caused him to be unsteady on his feet causing him to discontinue and start Keppra mg instead. Of note, on of , patient had blinking of eyes b/l. At this time, he had no evidence of seizure activity on EEG. Of note, pt was on Diazepam mg T per home dosing and CIWA protocol. He was also hydrated with banana bag on admission and then transitioned to PO folic acid and thiamine. Follow up conversation with Mr. the need for medication compliance, with neurology appointment follow-ups at . Depakote and Valium were both continued upon outpatient discharge. PSYCHIATRIC: Pt with history of being abused and suicide attempts in the past. During admission in ICU, endorsed passive SI but did not have a plan to hurt himself. Psychiatry evaluated Mr. noting his features of depression and PTSD; they noted the patient would likely benefit from psychotherapy as well as possible medication adjustment (esp higher dose SSRI; however, no safety concerns were reported for the patient. Of note, the patient also refused placement or any psychiatric counseling. CARDIOLOGY: Monitored on telemetry. No abnormal rhythm was noted.

He was initially on the medical service prior to his surgery. A brief summary of his hospital course is follows: Mr was admitted on for inpatient management of his anasarca, chronic diarrhea, and chronic pancytopenia. With regards to his HIV, his last CD , viral load . Treated with HAART, home meds continued (abacavir, lamivudine, zidovudine, enfuvirtide, ritonavir, dapsone for pcp , famciclovir, fluconazole. With regards to his anasarca, this was postulated to be secondary to low oncotic pressure secondary to chronic pancytopenia as well as lymphatic insufficiency. Albumin level was checked several times, however, and was > , leading us to consider a multi-factorial etiology for the edema. CT abdomen was done to assess for retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy as a source of venous occlusion, but it was negative. Echo on this hospitalization revealed no significant change from the previous study in , with EF >%. Edema was managed initially with high-dose lasix, and then with metolazone. Diuretics caused only marginal improvement in LE edema, and caused the patient to be hypovolemic and hyponatremic. Diuretics were discontinued and patient was placed in compression stockings. With regards to his diarrhea, the patient was found to have C. diff positive stools and was started on a course of Flagyl for treatment. From an infectious disease standpoint, intermittent and chronic low-grade fevers gave way to frank fever spikes on day of hospitalization, along with development of R ear pain and a coincidentally positive sputum for AFB that was taken as an outpatient. Cultures of nose and ear revealed GPC in pairs from the sinus and pseudomonas from the ear. MRI ordered to assess extent of pseudomonal infection (see below indicated diffuse (R>L meningeal enhancement c/w menigitis. He was maintained on several courses of empiric antibiotics, as well as acyclovir possible HSV lesion in his ear. acyclovir course completed prior to viral culture results. He developed acute R ear pain with serosanguinous drainage early in this hospitalization, and ENT was promptly consulted for input. ENT input regarding mastoiditis indicates that no surgical intervention required even if pt were appropriate candidate. He had one sputum positive for AFB on . He was placed on resppiratory precautions until sets of negative sputums were obtained (no sputum samples from this hospitalization have been positive. He was treated empiracally for presumed MAC. With regards this his pancytpoenia , this was postulated to be initially to be secondary to his HIV marrow suppression. Recent BM biopsy from showed hypocellularity with no marrow infection, though cultures had never been sent. Patient experienced steady decline in cellular counts which prompted reevaluation of initial hypothesis and data. Marrow showed viral inclusion bodies (though there was no evidence of viral organsims, and therefore, serologies for CMV and Parvovirus B were sent. He was treated withIG g/kg/day to treat possible parvovirus and intiated on Procrit, , u/week. Surgery was consulted and due to his severe thrombocytopenia, the decision was made to procede with salvage splenectomy. He underwent splenectomy via open technique on (please see the operative note of Dr. for full details. Post-operatively, he initially did well and was extubated and transferred out of the ICU by post-op day and started on a clear liquid diet. However, he began to have oliguric renal failure and was transferred back to the ICU for close monitoring. Within a day his renal failure became anuric and he presented with an encephalopathic picture. Renal consultation assessed the patient's renal failure as multifactorial in nature, including HIV nephropathy, renal failure secondary to amicar treatment for his MAC, and perioperative fluid changes. He was emergently intubated for mental status changes comprimising respiration. He was dialyzed for consecutive days starting on , however there was marginal improvement in his renal function. While is platelet counts did not drop post-splenectomy, he continued to present with clinical bleeding from his incision sites and it was presumed that his platelets were poorly functional secondary to uremia. Hematology recommended DDAVP and FFP which were given, as well as platelet transfusions. On a family meeting was held and the decision was made by the health care proxy to make him comfort measures only. He was extubated and expired shortly afterwards.

Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. was evaluated by the Trauma team in the Emergency Room and she had GCS . She was hypotensive to SBP 's and was fluid resuscitated with crystalloids and units PRBC. Free fluid was detected on the FAST scan and she was subsequently intubated. Once stabilized, she underwent radiographic imaging. She was reported to have both a splenic and liver laceration, small bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages, a right pneumothorax, and a left knee patellar tendon injury. She was taken to the Operating Room emergently and underwent an exploratory laparotomy, splenectomy and cholecystectomy. She tolerated the procedure well and returned to the TSICU in stable condition. She maintained stable hemodynamics and had adequate pain medication and sedation as she remained intubated. She was evaluated by Neurosurgery who recommended seizure prophylaxes and a repeat head CT. Interval images were taken and it was determined that there was no change in the subarachnoid hemorrhages. They also recommended a day course of anti seizure therapy prophylactically. The Ortho Trauma service was consulted because of her left knee injury and the possibility of a right posterior wall acetabular fracture. She was taken to the Operating Room on for a left knee incision drainage and patella tendon repair. Intra-op hip x-rays were taken and showed a stable right acetabular fracture with no need for surgical intervention. Her operative course was stable with minimal blood loss. She remained intubated and returned to the TSICU. She was extubated on without difficulty and maintained satisfactory oxygenation. Following transfer to the Trauma floor she was transitioned to oral analgesia and her diet was gradually advanced to regular. She was evaluated by physical therapy and was determined to be below her functional baseline and recommendations for a rehabilitation facility were addressed. She failed two voiding trials but hopefully her retention will improve as she increases herbulation. During her hospitalization, she was evaluated by the social worker who provided additional support to her and her family. Her vital signs are stable and she is afebrile.

His wife reports that he has been increasingly fatigued and lethargic for the last three days. She noticed that he has also had loose stools for the last three or four days but does not know if they were bloody or melanotic. Yesterday he was noticeably out of breath when climbing up stairs; she thought this might be because he had missed several sessions of his exercise/physical therapy class at Rehab. He attended a session of this class today, and the physical therapist noticed that he seemed weak and tired; and on taking his blood pressure found him to be lower than usual (he is generally somewhat hypertensive and declining. The PT called anbulance and he was brought to the . . In the emergency department, his initial vitals were T ., HR , BP /, RR , O sat % RA.

Brief Hospital Course: This year old Korean woman with a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease (baseline Cr . presented to an outside hospital with epigastric discomfort and was found by EKG and cardiac enzymes to have an MI and was transferred to for further care and cardiac catheterization. On presentation the patient was hypertensive to SBP 's and was started on a nitroglycerin drip. The patient was maintained on aspirin and heparin gtt and plavix loaded. Her EKG was concerning for evidence of ST elevations in the LAD territory and appeared to be consistent for Syndrome in the precordial leads. Given theount of myocardium at risk, the plan was to take her to catheterization. Repro (abciximab was started. Hindering this was her kidney disease which had apparently worsened with Cr up to the -. range so initially, medical management was pursued. Echo showed mild symmetric LVH, normal regional global systolic function LVEF >%.The patient remained hemodynamically stable and did not complain of chest pain, except for a brief episode on HD . On HD however, the patient developed worsening chest pain at rest and she was taken for urgent catheterization that AM. Mucomyst and bicarbonate infusion were given in an effort to protect her kidney function. After catheterization, her kidney function continued to improve and her creatinine improved, . upon discharge. . CAD: On catheterization, a mid LAD % lesion was visualized and successfully stented with a drug eluting stent. The procedure was without complication. She will need aspirin and plavix as managed by her cardiologist, Dr.. She was sent out on aspirin, plavix, bblocker, ace-i, statin. . Hypertension: The patient persisted with hypertension, and blood pressures ranging 's/'s. She was placed on metoprolol and titrated up to toprolL mg daily. Amlodipine was added and titrated up to mg daily. Lisinopril was initially held given her acute renal failure, however after catheterization her creatinine began to decrease back to her baseline. Lisinopril was therefore added and titrated up to mg PO daily, then mg PO daily to help control her blood pressure. . Acute on Chronic Renal failure: baseline Cr is ., presented with ., increased to .. Upon discharge, it was . days after catheterization. Continued creatinine above baseline of . possibly from cath dye load. She will need continued monitoring as an outpatient and titration of her lisinopril prn. Renal ultrasound showing atrophic kidneys as above. She has follow-up with Dr. , nephrology. . Anemia: Iron studies revealed iron deficiency anemia in the setting of anemia of chronic disease. The patient was administered one dose of ferrlecit, and continued on oral iron supplements. She was instructed to follow up with nephrology, who plan to administer epogen once her blood pressure is under better control. . Distal aorta psuedoaneurysm and distal aortic stenosis: Visualized on cardiac cath, recommended to receive further imaging. Because of her renal failure, no CTA could be done, so a U/S was completed which did not definitively show a psuedoaneurysm. Further imaging with CT was recommended for the psuedoaneurysm and stenosis, which we are recommending be done as an outpatient. . Rhythm: Sinus rhythm. . Valves: Echo without valvular abnormality .

Mildly increased portal fibrosis with some periportal extension seen on Trichrome stain. . Fragments of venous wall with subendothelial lymphoplasmacytic inflammation. . No stainable iron on iron stain. Note: The above biopsies show two distinct histologic patterns of injury; one with bile ductular proliferation with intraductal neutrophils and cholestasis which suggests ascending cholangitis or sepsis, and the other with portal, predominantly lymphocytic inflammation with occasional foci of prominent plasma cells, lymphocytic bile duct injury, and lobular apoptotic hepatocytes. The latter findings in a patient nearly years following liver transplantation suggest a possible immune-mediated hepatitis, or alternatively, a component of treated acute cellular rejection. Given the lymphocyte-predominant pattern of portal inflammation and the setting of immunosuppression, workup by the Hematopathology consult team to rule out a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder is warranted and will be reported in an addendum. Dr. was notified of the findings by telephone by Dr. on . ADDENDUM : Reticulin stain shows normal plate thickness and distribution in the limited trans-venous sample. Addendum added by: DR. /rna Date: Hematopathology Addendum: T-cell dominant mixed lymphoid infiltrate, favor reactive, see note. Note: Sections of the specimen reveal mixed periportal inflammation composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils and rare plasma cells. By immunohistochemistry the cells express CD, CD and CD confirming that there is a mixed population of B-cells and T-cells. CD highlights occasional plasma cells; however kappa and lambda stain cannot be interpreted due to high background staining. MIB- stains occasional hepatocytes and lymphocytes. LMP stain is negative. DIAGNOSIS: Liver, allograft, needle core biopsy: . Moderate portal and mild lobular mixed inflammation including prominent neutrophils with associated bile duct proliferation and focally prominent plasma cells. . Severe hepatocellular and canalicular cholestasis. . Focal lymphocytic cholangitis and bile duct damage seen. . No steatosis is seen. . Focal areas of centrivenular mononuclear cell infiltrate with prominent plasma cells. . Trichrome stain shows increased portal/periportal fibrosis with focal septal formation (Stage fibrosis. . Iron stain shows no increase in stainable iron. Note: The presence of plasma cells, particularly in the area of centrivenular region and focal lymphocytic cholangitis is consistent with an immune-mediated process. The differential diagnosis includes acute cellular rejection vs. post-transplant chronic immune mediated hepatitis. However, the prominent neutrophilic infiltrate is unusual and a concurrent biliary obstruction and sepsis cannot be entirely excluded. Compared to the prior biopsy, there is an increase in the degree of inflammation, particularly the neutrophilic and plasma cell components. Evaluation is limited by technical artifact due to processing. Dr. was notified of the preliminary findings on by Dr. . ADDENDUM: An immunohistochemical stain for Cd is negative. Satisfactory controls were obtained. Addendum added by: DR. /tkb Date: Clinical: year old with history of liver transplant in , now with worsening liver function tests of unclear etiology.

There is a high likelyhood that this lesion with heal. High dose PPI. Keep INR < .. Return patient to hospital . Brief Hospital Course: Mr. is a M w history of Hep B cirrhosis s/p liver transplant , IgA nephropathy s/p renal transplant in who initially presented with epigastric pain, abnormal LFTs, AP, INR, and TBili, initially s/p ERCP for a working diagnosis of cholangitis with septic shock, was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and later had PTC placed with no subsequent change in LFTs. Course further complicated by increasing LFTs s/p liver biopsies, melena s/p EGDs, renal failure, and respiratory distress, and course of high dose steroids for autoimmune hepatitis versus rejection. . Acute liver failure: The patient initially presented with possible cholangitis, despite no evidence of bile duct dilation on imaging; received dose Unasyn in ED, but has allergy so that was stopped and patient was covered with Cipro/Flagyl. The patient went for ERCP and during which bile duct was NOT cannulated given patient hepatojejunostomy s/p liver transplant. After procedure, pt was hypotension, bolused, and antibiotics broadened and sent to unit out of concern for sepsis. In spite of treatment for presumed cholangitis, the patient's LFTs did not improve. The patient's LFTs worsened throughout his course and in total he underwent three biopsies. The initial biopsies showed evidence of bile duct proliferation which could be c/w obstruction, as well as a second immune mediated process. Because of the possible concern for obstruction, the patient was kept on antibiotics and a PTC was placed. However, in spite of biliary decompression, the patient's LFTs continued to trend up. . In order to rule out a secondary process like PTLD (as there was some lymphocytic proliferation on initial biopsies, as well the patient underwent PET scan, which was negative. During this time, the patient's LFTs were continuing to increase. Repeat biopsies showed similar bile duct proliferation, but the second biopsy also showed more evidence of an autoimmune process, either an autoimmune hepatitis versus a rejection picture. Because of this, the patient was started on mg methylpred pulse steroids. mg methylpred was not used because of the suspicion of underlying infection; the patient was also continued on broad spectrum antibiotics during the pulse steroid treatment. In spite of the pulse dose steroids, the patient's LFTs continued to rise. An extensive work up was pursued for viral etiologies of her liver failure and he was found to be , anti-mitochondial negative, Hep B core ab postive with Hep B viral load <, anti-smooth muscle titer :, normal IgG, negative EBV, CMV, negative Hep D ab and PCR, negative HSV, Varicella, LCMV negative,ong others. . After receiving the pulse dose of steroids, the patient underwent a third liver biopsy which showed some decrease in inflammation, with evidence of possible chronic rejection; however, no definite diagnosis could be made based on biopsy, as pathology not completely consistent with rejection. At this point the patient's LFTs were continuing to trend up, with Tbilis in the s. The option of retranplanting the patient came up, but before a full pretransplant evaluation began, the patient declined the option. The next possible option for him was ATG. However, given the patient's worsening condition, volume overload, and worsening creat, as well as his desire to just go home, it was decided to not go ahead and give the patient ATG. Instead, he was discharged to home with hospice. . s/p renal and liver transplant: The patient was kept on his home immunosuppressive agents (tacrolimus and MMF, with his tacrolimus dose adjusted according to AM tacro levels. While in the MICU for the first time, his tacr level was found to be ~ , and his tacro was held for a few days and then restarted at a lower dose. The patient's tacrolimus levels were adjusted to . mg and towards the end of his hospitalization, his MMF was increased to mg . It is unclear whether the patient worsening LFTs were due to rejection, as his biopsy results were never clearly indicative of rejection. Moreover, his acute renal failure may also have been related to rejection, but a biopsy was never done (see below. melena: After getting the first ERCP, the patient reported having some melena. He was scoped on and found to have oozing frompulla, s/p epinephrine injection and coag of site. The patient continued to have melena after this procedure and also had a crit drop, which prompted rescoping him on . On this endoscopy, found portal hypertensive gastropathy and ulcer with adherent clot in the area of the papilla and was given injections of epinephrine. Because no definite source of bleeding was found, the patient underwent colonoscopy, which was negative for any sources of bleeding, and a capsule endoscopy. . hypoxia: During this hospitalization, the patient developed an oxygen requirement. Initially, it was thought to be fluid overload, as during his first MICU stay, he was very net fluid positive. He was also found to be very crackly on lung exam, and had improved breathing with Lasix. CRXs at this time also showed evidence of pulmonary edema. Lasix was also used cautiously, as he was also in acute renal failure and his creat was trending up during the hospitalization. However, as the hospitalization progressed and the patient't liver failure worsened, his respiratory status also worsened. By the time of discharge, he was on -L NC, and it is likely that hepato-pulmonary syndrome was also a component to this new O requirement. The patient also had a TTE with bubble study done that showed evidence of a small PFO vs. pulmonary AV fistula. The patient's oxygen requirement did not improve and he was discharged to home hospice with home O for comfort. . in setting of Renal Transplant: Initially, the patient' creat was . (baseline around .-., then began to trend up. Was initally thought to be prerenal azotemia, and creat improved with fluids. Of note, the patient also had a tacrolimus level that peaked ~, and tacrolimus toxicity was also on the differential. The option of renal biopsy was also considered, but since his creat responded to fluids initially, it was never pursued. The patient's creat began to trend up again, and given the possibility of cirrhosis based on imaging, the possibility of HRS was considered. The results of the third liver biopsy showed that the patient did not have cirrhosis and the possibilty of rejection of his kidney was raised, as HRS was less likely at this time. However, given patient's decompensation at this point and his desire to go home, kidney biopsy was not pursued. During the hospitalization, medications were renally dosed and nephrotoxic drugs avoided. . ileus: The patient developed an ileus during the hospitalization, unclear etiology. His lytes were repleted aggressively, and the pt was on bowel rest when severe. KUBs showed dilated loops of bowel without any evidence of free air. Initially, the ileus resolved, and diet was advanced as tolerated. However, it recurred again and the patient was kept NPO again. An NGT was attempted, but the patient could not tolerate it. . Hepatitis B: The patient was not on any antiviral therapy as an outpatient. His Hep B viral load was less than , and he was initially started on mg daily, which was then switched to mg daily given his worsening renal function. . . History of SMV Thrombosis: The patient was diagnosed with SMV thrombosis a few months ago and was on coumadin at home. Early on in the hospitalization he was on a heparin drip. However, when he started having melena, all anticoagulation was held. . goals of care: The patient was initially full code on admission, however towards the end of the hospitalization, we had a goals of care conversation with the patient and his family, as his liver enzymes continued to increase in spite of our treatment efforts. During these conversations, the patient made it clear he was not willing to undergo another liver transplant and he decided he wanted to be DNR/DNI. The patient also declined the option for AGT and decided that he wants to go home. The patient was set up for home hospice. . L arm swelling: The patient has some L arm swelling early on during the admission. A ultrasound was done showing a clot in a superficial vein. Warm compresses were used and Tylenol (less than grams daily was used for pain. pain . HTN: The patient's home antihypertensive medications, including amlodipine, metoprolol, and lisinopril were held. . Hyperlipemia: Given the patient's liver injury, his home simvastatin was held. . GERD: The patient's omeprazole was also held as it can cause cholestasis. . Depression: The patient's cymbalta was also held as it can cause cholestasis. .

Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Activity Status: Bedbound. Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. , It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were hospitalized at . You were admitted because you were having abdominal pain and your urine was rust colored. We initially treated your infection with antibiotics, but there was no improvement in your condition and your condition and liver enzymes continued to worsen. We also placed a drain into your bile ducts so that we could decompress them and drain all of the infected fluid, but that also did not improve your liver enzymes. . You underwent three liver biopsies in total, and there is still no clear explanation for why your liver is failing right now. The biopsies showed that you some evidence of obstruction, as well as an immune mediated process that could be rejection. We started you on steroids, but there was no improvement on the steroids either. . In addition to the worsening liver enzymes you also had a problem with in your stools. We think that this started after you had an endoscopy to look at your bile ducts. Because of this bleeding, you had mutiple endoscopies that were looking for a bleeding source, including a colonoscopy and a capsule endoscopy (where you swallowed a camera pill. . Your kidney function also suffered while you were here. We think that it was initially related to not having enough fluid going to your kidneys. Your kidneys initially responded to fluids, but then continued to worsen. . Your breathing was also affected while you were in the hospital. We initially thought this was due to getting too much fluid to help perfuse your kidneys better. You responded to medications that helped take some of this extra fluid off, but this medication also affected your kidney function. As your liver failure progressed, we think that your worsening respiratory status was due to the liver failure itself. . We are discharging you home with hospice care. . We made the following changes to your medications: STOP all of your home medications START medications for your comfort only, including morphine, ativan, sarna lotion, benadryl, atarax, oxygen, and oxycodone as needed Followup Instructions: CMO :",Discharge summary,"0389,570,5845,5570,5761,99682,2851,5601,45383,5723,7824,4561,V420,99811,99591,7906,4019,5880,53081,53789,32723,73300,2724,311,V1209,V4579,V1272,V1251,V4986,E8798"

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. is an year old woman with multiple medical problems including severe AS (valve area .-. cm in , AF on coumadin, COPD, and diastolic CHF who was admitted from cardiology clinic today with progressive shortness of breath. Her hospital course by problem is as follows: . Leukocytosis/Pneumonia- Had baseline leukocytosis of to during hospitalization. Was elevated to . -> now approx. .-.. She has remained afebrile, lung exam non-focal, with only a slight clinical productive cough. Could also be related to her chronic steroid use but there are concerns for a developing PNA.Urine. blood, and sputum cultures are pending with no growth to date. Legionella urine antigen was nagetive. Vancomycin and Cefepime was renally dosed and in the absence of signs of significant infection and with a downtrending WBC count, she was changed to oral cefpodoxime and levofloxacin on to complete an day course of antibiotics. . . Acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation- Patient has known history of diastolic CHF with EF of % on echo in . On admission, patient's exam was significant for several clinical indices of cardiac failure with blateral crackles on auscultation, elevated JVP and LE edema. She was initialy diuresed with furosemide and then a furosemide infusion and her volume status improved. She was switched to PO lasix and maintained stable weights. She was given a low salt diet and fluid restricted to mL, with strict monitoring of her weights and Is/Os. Echo showed hyperdynamic systolic function with EF % and severe AS (valve area . cm. She underwent cardiac catheterization which showed moderately severe diastolic dysfunction, clean coronaries and severe AS (valve area . cm. Her home ToprolL was converted to metoprolol tartrate and was uptitrated to mg PO B. Following aortic valvuloplasty, she required further furosemide whilst her renal function was cautiously monitored. She became hypotensive and oliguric and required transfer to the CCU (see below. While she was in the CCU, her volume status was carefully monitored and she was initially bolused with smallounts of fluid, at which point her urine output improved. She then showed signs of volume overload with worsening dyspnea and required gentle diuresis with lasix. She was transitioned to her home dose of lasix ( mg PO qAM; mg PO qPM and remained euvolemic. She was discharged on this regimen. . . Hypotension- Patient became hypotensive and oliguric with lasix diuresis and was transferred to the CCU. She was felt to be overdiuresed and was bolused with fluid; beta blocker was held. CXR was concerning for pneumonia. She was started on empiric coverage with vancomycin and cefepime and blood cultures were sent which ultimately returned negative. She also received stress dose steroids as there was some thought that she might have adrenal insufficiency with her chronic steroids. She responded well to the boluses, and ended up needing a little diuresis to get her closer to euvolemia. The stress dose steroids were discontinued and she was put back on her home regimen. . . Aortic stenosis- Patient has a known history of severe AS on echo in with valve area of .-.cm and was admitted from clinic with concern that this has worsened in the months given her decline in functional status and severe shortness of breath. Echo showed stable to slight worsening of AS with valve area of . cm, but increased gradient ( mmHg, previously in . Cardiac catheterization was performed and showed valve area of . and mean gradient of . mmHg. She under went aortic valvuloplasty with balloon inflations and after the procedure her mean gradient had improved to . mmHg and her aortic valve was appx . cm. The procedure was without complications. . . Atrial fibrillation- Patient has a known history of AF, and remained in AF with rate in the s to s on telemetry for most of her hospitalization. Her rate crept up into the s, and her metoprolol was uptitrated for better control. At the time of discharge she was receiving mg PO B. Patient was on coumadin for anticoagulation at home. During hospitalization, coumadin was held and she was kept on heparin in anticipation of her cardiac catheterization. She was restarted on coumadin on on her home dose and became supratherapeutic. Coumadin was held once more and was . on discharge. She was discharged with instructions to stop taking her coumadin and take plavix daily as she has an aspirin allergy until she follows up with Dr. . On day of discharge, her HR was in the s despite being on metoprolol mg - this may be secondary to her use of albuterol nebulizer treatments. We instructed the patient to limit her use of these treatments to - times per day. We did not further uptitrate her beta blocker, but would consider perhaps adding on a calcium channel blocker in the outpatient setting should her pressures tolerate it. . . COPD- Patient has a history of COPD and has been on L home oxygen and standing advair and spiriva since . She has a chronic cough productive of white phlegm and is dyspnic with any exertion. Patient is not wheezing but had generally poor air entry on examination. CXR was similar to previous. We therefore continued her home spiriva and in addition she received regular albuterol and ipratropium nebulisers at q intervals. She was maintained on oxygen L via nasal cannulae, with goal sats in the mid s. Following days of stress dose methylprednisolone, she was continued on her home prednisone mg daily. She was discharged with ipratroprium and albuterol nebulizer treatments and her home tiotroprium. . . Chest tightness- Patient reports has history of chest tightness at home, at rest, usually while sleeping, lasting a couple of minutes and usually relieved with deep breathing. Had a brief episode on , with no new ECG changes and negative cardiac enzymes and was felt to be non-cardiac and potentially anxiety-related. . . Left calf pain- Patient complained of new posterior left calf pain on palpation on . On exam, firm and TTP. LENI study was negative. . . Leukocytosis/Pneumonia- Patient had baseline leukocytosis of to on admission which was attributed to her home steroid use. WBCs bumped to .. She remained afebrile, with a non-focal lung exam, with only a slight clinical productive cough. CXR was concerning for a possible RLL pneumonia or atelectasis, she was commenced on cefepime and vancomycin on as per the HAP policy. She remained afebrile and antibiotics were changed to oral levofloxacin and cefpodoxime on to complete an day course. Vancomycin was dropped as MRSA pneumonia was believed unlikely in the setting of her clinical presentation. UA, UCx and legionalla UAg were negative and blood cultures showed no growth. . . RA/SLE- chronic issue. Continued on her home prednisone mg daily with days of stress dose methylprednisolone and was changed back to her home regimen on resolution of her hypotension. . . Osteoporosis- No active issues. Patient was continued on her home calcium and vitamin D. . . Neuropathic pain- No active issues. Was continued on her home gabapentin. . . Shoulder pain- Patient complained of some left shoulder pain while in the CCU. There was no point tenderness on examination and motion was intact. Shoulder films should no fractures or dislocations. Patient had some relief of symptoms with daily lidocaine patches. . . Goals of Care- Patient was DNR/DNI for this hospitalization. Palliative care was consulted to discuss goals of care with the patient (see OMR note. The patient is not ready to initiate hospice at this time and would like to be hospitalized should it be necessary in the future. Palliative care recommended continued discussions with her cardiologist and PCP regarding when it might be appropriate to stop hospitalization and focus on comfort/hospice, as well as efforts to streamline the patient's medication list.

CXR: AP SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE CHEST @ : P.M.: Compared to prior study on , there appears to be increased interstitial markings in the left lung and at the right base sparing the right upper lung zone. This pattern may be seen in interstitial edema in a patient with emphysema. . Brief Hospital Course: Floor course : Pt was initially admitted to the floor service for further care of a COPD exacerbation. On the evening of admission (, pt had an episode of left sided CP with concurrent SOB that improved with SL NTG. Pt's troponin and CK were subsequently positive (. and and EKG had lateral ST depressions so he was started on a heparin drip. A cardiology consult was obtained on and further medical management was initially presued. On the evening of HD , the pt developed acutely worsening SOB with tachypnia to the s. ABG showed .// so he was transferred to the MICU for management of hypercarbic respiratory failure including noninvasive ventilation. . MICU course: In the MICU, pt's respiratory status improved with noninvasive ventilation, continuous nebs, steroids, and lasix. Anxiety related SOB was also been an issue for which pt received klonipin. Pt continued to be followed by cardiology for his NSTEMI and had a peak troponin of . at : PM on . Echo was done on showing a LVEF of to % with severe AS. Pt continued to have severe respiratory distress requiring continuous BIPAP and persistent troponin elevation thought to bue due to secondary demand ischemia. A cardiac cath was not obtained as it would have required intubation which the pt did not desire. TPN was started for nutritional support on . Pt was weaned off of noninvasive ventilation on the evening of and has been having an oxygen sat of % on L NC. He was also started on an insulin drip on secondary to persistently elevated blood glucose levels. Insulin drip was weaned off prior to being transferred to the floor for further care; pt was continued on NPH and insulin sliding scale. . Floor course : . . Respiratory- On the floor, pt continued to have good O saturations ranging from -% on -Lnc. Pt was continued to be aggressively treated for COPD with standing and prn albuterol nebs, atrovent nebs, montelukast, azithromycin, and steroid taper. Pt was seen by pulmonary consult. From their recommendations, we discontinued atrovent and started spiriva. We also switched from azithromycin to bactrim. Azithromycin has anti-inflammatory properties, but there is still little good evidence for its benefit in COPD. Pulmonary felt that Bactrim would be a better antibiotic, in the the setting of long-term steroids since it has PCP . Advair was added the the regimen. Prednisone taper was continued. The taper is to be as follows: Prednisone days, mg days, mg days, then continue with mg. Klonipin which was given for anxiety was discontinued secondary to lethargy. Pt will follow-up with outpatient pulmonologist Dr. . . . CAD/ Pt had a NSTEMI on which was felt to be most probably due to demand but acute coronary syndrome could not be absolutely excluded. He was on heparin for days and was d/c'ed in setting of left subconjunctival hemorrhage. Since pt is just recovering from his COPD exacerbation, we felt that it would be safer to defer cardiac cath as an outpatient. Pt agreed with this plan and stated his wish not to be cath'ed during this admission. Cardiology was okay with this plan and they plan to re-evaluate him in weeks. In the meantime, pt was continued on with medical management. He was continued on diltiazem for rate control (beta blocker not used in order to avoid it's bronchospastic effects. However, diltiazem was unable to be titrated up secondary to blood pressure intolerance; pt's HR remained in - range. Pt was continued on captopril, but most doses were held secondary to blood pressure intolerance. For now, we will discontinue ACEi; please add it back on as tolerated. Pt was continued on aspirin and statin. . . Severe aortic stenosis- Pt found to have severe aortic stenosis on echo during this admission. The plan to be have cardiac cath as an outpatient after pulmonary rehab for a formal assessment of the aortic valve. We avoided beta blocker and nitoglycerin. . . Steroid induced diabetes mellitus- Pt was continued on NPH and sliding scale. Oral glipizide was added. Pt is on Metformin as an outpatient, but we did not restart that since pt may be at increased risk for lactic acidosis in the setting of hypoxia or cardiac ischemia. Please continue to titrate up glipizide and adjust NPH as indicated. . . Pt had a difficult time tolerating diltiazem and ACEi given his low blood pressures ranging from - systolic. We will continue diltiazem for rate control and hold ACEi for now. Please titrate up dilt for better rate control. If BP tolerates, can consider restarting ACEi . . Subconjunctival hemorrhage- Occurred in setting of heparin and noninvasive positive pressure. There was slow resolution of the hemorrhage. Pt was continued on erythromycin ointment qid. Ophtho stated that it may take weeks for the hemorrhage to resolve. After then, pt should be safe for elective cardiac cath. Should anti-coagulation be urgently indicated prior to resolution of hemorrhage, ophtho feels the hemorrhage should not be an absolute contraindication.

194687.0,": : : Sex: M Service: MICU CHIEF COMPLAINT: Cardiac arrest. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a year old man who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit status post cardiac arrest. History was obtained per the Emergency Department report as well as from the patient's family. Information was very limited regarding the circumstances of his cardiac arrest. Reportedly, the patient was at a local restaurant where he was noted to be unresponsive. EMS was called and reported to arrive on scene within three minutes. The patient was asystolic but regained a perfusing rhythm after mg of Epinephrine and mg of Atropine. He was intubated in the field and brought to the Emergency Department. He remained unresponsive despite the administration of Narcan. CT examinations of the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis were all unremarkable. Initial chest-ray showed a left retrocardiac opacity and prominent interstitium though his lung volumes were low. Subsequent chest-ray showed right main stem intubation with left lung collapse which had corrected with withdrawal of the endotracheal tube. The patient was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for induced hypothermia given his hemodynamic stability, ongoing unresponsiveness and recent out of hospital cardiac arrest. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension. Chronic low back pain, s/p lumbar discectomy . Cirrhosis. h/o stab wound complicated by pneumothorax. h/o lower extremity cellulitis. s/p cholecystectomy. Peripheral neuropathy. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: According to his pharmacy, he was on: . OxyContin mg p.o. qhours. . Percocet. . Nortriptyline. . Neurontin mg four times a day SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is divorced. His son is a policeman working in . He drinks greater than one case of beer per day. He has a history of abuse of Percocet according to his brother. is currently homeless. He was recently arrested for altering a prescription according to his pharmacy. He had recently filled a prescription for tablets of Percocet as well as tablets of OxyContin early last month. FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for any history of sudden death or coronary artery disease. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission, temperature was ., blood pressure /, heart rate , respiratory rate . In general, he was unarousible, intubated, not on any sedation. Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - His pupils were equal and three millimeters. They were minimally reactive. His sclerae were anicteric. The cardiac examination was unremarkable without murmurs. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. His abdomen had normal bowel sounds, soft and nontender. Extremities had multiple bilateral lower extremity excoriations. Neurologic examination - he was unarousible and without sedation. He had no spontaneous movements. Flaccid. Extremities - Babinski reflex was equivocal bilaterally. LABORATORY DATA: At the time of admission, laboratories were remarkable for a partial thromboplastin time of ., INR ., potassium ., glucose , lactate was initially .. Urine toxicology screen was negative. Serum toxicology screen was positive for TCAs. Tylenol level was . Alcohol level was . Initial blood gas was .///. HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiac arrest - His arrest was of unknown etiology at the time of admission. No further history was ever gained about his cardiac arrest throughout his hospitalization. CT angiogram had been negative for pulmonary embolism. The patient had an echocardiogram on , which showed a normal ejection fraction and trivial mitral regurgitation; otherwise no obvious abnormalities were seen. Given the patient had an out of hospital arrest, remained unresponsive despite hemodynamic stability, he was treated with induced hypothermia and with cold packs and a cooling blanket were placed with goals of reducing his core body temperature to degrees Celsius for a period of twelve hours at which point he would be rewarmed over the subsequent six hours. This was done, however, as in problem number two below, we were not successful in any neurologic recovery. Neurology - The patient remained unresponsive after the induced hypothermia, the patient was noticed to develop myoclonic jerks and occasional fluttering of his eyelids. Electroencephalogram revealed the patient was experiencing persistent seizure activity. Neurology was consulted and the patient was treated very aggressively, loaded with multiple drugs, including Ativan and Propofol drips. The patient continued to demonstrate seizure activity despite this. He was loaded with Dilantin and ultimately was treated with a Pentobarb coma. After multiple attempts of weaning the Pentobarb, the patient was continually reverting to status epilepticus which was never able to be suppressed. Infectious disease - Over the course of his hospital stay, the patient's white blood cell count rose to a peak of . Multiple cultures were done and the patient was ultimately found to have methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection. For all these infections, the patient was treated with Vancomycin and he was also on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia at the time of his admission. Blood cultures cleared by . Sputum culture as late as , however was still positive for coagulase positive Staphylococcus which was methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The patient remained gravely ill throughout his hospital stay and had multiple meetings were held with his family with his son being his next of . Ultimately it was decided that the patient's wishes would be to not be maintained in a vegetative state and given his poor prognosis ultimately the decision was made to pursue comfort measures only. With these goals of care, the patient expired on . The family did consent to a postmortem examination. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Cardiac arrest.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination, the patient was well appearing. Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended. Extremities: Warm and well perfused with no edema. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to on , where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times three, performed by Dr. as follows: Left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with a postoperative left ventricular ejection fraction of % and preserved biventricular systolic function. The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit off any pressors or inotropic agents. The patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition. His chest tubes were removed without complication and he was begun on earlybulation. He was noted on postoperative day number two to have an irregular heart beat and rhythm strips demonstrated a sinus arrhythmia with P waves of varying morphologies, diagnosed as a wandering pacemaker syndrome. He also had several episodes of inability to speak and twitching of his hands, for which a neurology consult was obtained. The neurologist who saw the patient felt that it was probably an epileptic phenomena with stereotyped repetition of the same scenario, and a neurology workup was suggested as an outpatient. Otherwise, the patient did very well and, by postoperative day number four, he was ready for discharge. Upon discharge, his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. He had a irregular heart rate. His sternum was stable and dry. His abdomen was soft. His extremities demonstrated trace edema. The patient also underwent a CT scan of the abdomen, pelvis and chest which demonstrated no evidence of any occult malignancies, and a CT scan of the head which was unimpressive for any significant intracranial pathology.

Brief Hospital Course: AORTIC STENOSIS On admission, Mr. EF was ~-% with moderate mitral regurgitation and critical aortic stenosis (valve area of . and mean gradient of . Surgical aortic valve replacement was deferred on this admission because of the patient's worsening renal function and multiple comorbidities, placing him at high risk for complications with an open heart surgery. A percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty was performed on without complication. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION He has known chronic atrial fibrillation, with a baseline LBBB. Upon arrival to the CCU, Mr. was found to be in AFib with a rapid ventricular rate, which induced hypoxia and chest pain. After intravenous furosemide and metoprolol, the patient quickly returned to his baseline rhythm of atrial fibrillation with a rate in the 's, and his shortness of breath and chest pain improved. A chest ray showed pulmonary edema, which slowly improved over the hospital course with continued diruesis. He was kept on heparin throught the admission for anticoagulation and was bridged to Coumadin at the end of his hospital stay. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE Mr. had a CABG in with SVG to the OM and LIMA to the LAD. His cath on showed patent LAD and % stenosis of the SVG; thus, a bare metal stent was placed in the SVG to OM. He was continued on aspirin and plavix for anti-platelet therapy. HYPERTENSION He was continued on metoprolol succinate andlodipine with good control of his blood pressure.

Pleural effusion. CXR: Borderline cardiomegaly. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. Retrocardiac opacity. Brief Hospital Course: yo M with PMH of HTN presents with DOE and new onset atrial fibrillation CAD: Pt had a normal ECHO in . EKG showed T wave inversion and pt ruled out for MI with negative cardiac enzymes. PUMP: Per OSH report and confirmed on CXR, pt had cardiomegaly. This was though to be due to either tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy, idiopathic cardiomyopathy, viral cardiomyopathy or alcohol induced cardiomyopathy. Other etiology were ruled out including hemochromatosis (normal Iron and TIBC, although Ferritin elevated, thyroid disease (normal TSH, HIV and viral hepatitis. Pt responded well to lasix with improved shortness of breath and oxygen requirement. RHYTHM: Atrial fibrillation with RVR. Unclear if dilated cardiomyopathy was the primary etiology with secondary afib, or if chronic paroxysmal afib is the cause of the dilation. ECHO did not reveal any structural abnormalities other than a reduced ejection fraction, there was no evidence of pulmonary causes and thyroid disease was ruled out. Pt was initially rate controlled with a diltiazem drip, later transitioned to rate control with beta blocker. Pt was initially anticoagulated with heparin. After TTE and TEE to rule out thrombus, pt underwent cardioversion which was only transiently successful before the rhythm reverted to atrial fibrillation. He was then started on Amiodarone load and anticoagulation with Coumadin and Lovenox drip. HTN: Pt was titrated up on lisinopril and metoprolol. Elevated LFTs: Unclear etiology as pattern is neither obstructive nor consistent with etoh, viral or ischemia. Pt denied abdominal/RUQ tenderness. Hepatotoxic meds were avoided and LFTs remained stably elevated. OSA: Pt evaluated by respiratory but did not tolerate CPAP. He was counseled to follow up evaluation for OSA and CPAP as an outpt. He was noted to have confirmed periods of apnea and desats to s on monitor with following episodes of tachypnea and resolving sats. ETOH ABUSE: Pt did not show signs of withdrawl but was maintained on a CIWA scale and prn Diazepam or Ativan.

Since the prior exam, there has been further decrease in size of multiple collections. The retrosternal collection centered behind the manubrium and upper sternum has decreased in size and density, which suggests an evolving hematoma. The periaortic collection is likely comprised of two regions, including an intrapericardial component of pericardial effusion containing locules of air, and an extrapericardial component extending cranially along the aorta. Both collections have decreased in size, and there is much less air within the pericardial space. Overall, this collection has improved greatly from the prior exam of . Additionally, inflammatory changes and stranding in the retrosternal space has also improved. Additional pericardial fluid layering dependently, moderate in size, is unchanged. A defect in the subcutaneous tissues overlying the sternum is compatible with recent debridement. However, the sternum itself demonstrates new lucency on either side of the sternotomy line, concerning for developing dehiscence or osteomyelitis. The sternal closure wires remain intact and in unchanged position at this time. Aortic graft material, aortic valve prosthesis and a right PICC remain in place. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are noted of the coronary arteries and the aortic arch. There is no new hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy by size criteria. The largest lymph node measures mm in the precarinal space. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy by size criteria. Lungs again demonstrate small bilateral pleural effusions with rounded atelectasis at the left lung base, in an unchanged configuration. Small calcified granulomas in the right lung are unchanged. There is no new lesion. The tracheobronchial tree is patent to subsegmental levels. The esophagus remains patulous, containing aerosolized material in the upper esophagus, placing the patient at increased risk for aspiration. While this exam is not optimized for assessment of the abdomen, a right hepatic cyst is unchanged, and there are no acute abnormalities in the upper abdomen. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: For discussion of the sternal changes, see above. No additional worrisome bony abnormalities are seen. Multilevel degenerative changes are present in the spine. IMPRESSION: . Interval improvement in the retrosternal and periaortic collections. The retrosternal collection likely represents evolving hematoma. The paraaortic collection likely reflect both intrapericardial fluid and extrapericardial collection, both improved. . New sternal lucencies on either side of the sternotomy line, concerning for developing dehiscence or osteomyelitis. Sternal wires remain intact. Followup imaging recommended as needed. . Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions with rounded atelectasis at the left lung base. Moderate pericardial effusion, also unchanged. . Patulous esophagus containing aerosolized material, placing the patient at increased risk for aspiration. Brief Hospital Course: year old man s/p aortic valve replacement/ascending aprta replacement on discharged home on . Readmitted with fevers and hypotension on . The sternal wound was noted to be erythematous on admission. He was pan cutured and started on broad spectrum antibiotics, initially Vancomycina nd Cipro which were changed to Nafcillin after cultures revealed STAPH AUREUS COAG +. Infectious disease service was consulted. The patient had developed acute renal failure with a BUN/Cr that peaked at /.. He also became hyponatremic durung this period and was placed on a free water restriction. The renal service was consulted and they felt the renal dysfunction was an interstitial nephritis likely from the Nafcilin. The antibiotics were changed and his renal function gradually improved. The wound continued to be erythematous and the pateint continued to have leukocytosis, on he was brought to the operating room for: Sternotomy wound superficial abscess drainage. The wound was left open and a VAC dressing was placed. After the wound was opened the erythema began to resolve and the leukocytosis also resolved.

Urinalysis moderate leukocyte esterase, nitrate positive, to white blood cells, many bacteria. Electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardia at . QTC was . There were no acute ST or T wave changes. Chest-ray showed mild cardiomegaly, mild congestive heart failure, left lower lobe collapse versus consolidation. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. . Sepsis: The patient was initially started on Levaquin given that they thought this was urosepsis. One out of four blood cultures were positive for gram positive cocci. Vancomycin was started. The urine culture began growing out coag positive staph aureus Methicillin sensitive. The blood cultures subsequently grew out Methicillin sensitive staph aureus so the patient's antibiotic regimen was changed to Oxacillin. Vancomycin had been discontinued. The patient during his hospital course on developed a pneumonia for which he was started on Levaquin. He completed a short course of Levaquin. The patient had a renal ultrasound done to exclude an abscess in his kidneys and there was no abscess.

Pulmonary: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the patient was continued on his regular inhaler regimen. . Renal: The patient had acute renal failure on admission, which was worsened after the Lasix drip. However, the patient's creatinine has now improved to his baseline. . Hematology: Anemia, during his unit stay the patient did develop some hematuria around the Foley site. His hematocrit drop to to . The patient was transfused units of packed red blood cells. Stool guaiacs were negative. The patient's hematocrit remained stable after the units of blood in the Intensive Care Unit. Coagulopathy, his INR was slightly elevated on admission. It was felt that this was likely secondary to a nutritional deficiency. The patient was given three days of oral vitamin K and his INR subsequently improved. . Skin: The patient had a grade sacral decube. He was seen by plastic surgery who recommended wet to dry dressings b.i.d. On the decube appeared to have a black appearance to it. Plastics was called. They said that this was the eschar formation of the decube and it was normal so they recommended continuing Duoderm or Adaptic dressing b.i.d. and keeping the area clean. . Electrolytes: The patient had persistent hypocalcemia during his hospital stay, which was repleted. . The patient had complained of leg pain during his hospital course. There was no localizing signs or symptoms. It was felt that this could likely be a neuropathic pain. The patient was started on Neurontin mg po q.h.s.

HISTORY: Status post fall from feet. COMPARISON: No previous studies. Torso CT performed on the same day is available for correlation. TECHNIQUE: Axial noncontrast multidetector CT images of the thoracic spine were obtained. Sagittal and coronal reformatted images were performed. FINDINGS: There is a comminuted fracture of T vertebra, which involves the body, right pedicle, and bilateral posterior elements - lamina and facets. Since all three columns of the spine are involved, this fracture is highly unstable. It is associated with a moderate to severe anterior dislocation of T with respect to T. There are multiple fragments in the spinal canal, which is narrowed by roughly %-%. These findings are suggestive of severe spinal cord injury. There is a superior anterior corner fracture of the T vertebra. There is a fracture through the T spinous process. There are fractures of the left fourth rib and right fifth ribs at the costovertebral junctions. There is associated anterior paraspinal hematoma at T through T. Degenerative spurring is present in the endplates at T-. There are bilateral pulmonary contusions and bilateral hemothoraces. Please refer to the torso CT of the same day for further detail.

Sagittal and coronal reformatted images were performed. FINDINGS: There is a fracture through the base of C spinous process, which involves the confluence of the right and left lamina. There may also be a fracture of the C spinous process, only visible on the sagittal images. There is no subluxation. There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. Mild loss of disc space height and moderate degenerative endplate spurring is noted at C/ and C/. IMPRESSION: Fracture of C posterior elements, and perhaps C spinous process.

MEDICAL CONDITION: year old man with ft fall and C spinous process fx; preop for T-T posterior fusion REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for fx CONTRAINDICATIONS for CONTRAST: None. THORACIC SPINE: As noted on the CT scan, there is a fracture dislocation of T and T. There is severe spinal canal compromise at the T level with compression of the spinal cord. Edema is identified within the spinal cord. Detail is limited due to motion artifact. Above and below the level of cord compression, the spinal cord has a normal course and caliber and normal signal intensity. There is edema in the paravertebral soft tissues of the upper thoracic spine, associated with a fracture dislocation at T and T. Findings were telephoned to Dr. at : a.m. on . MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE AND THORACIC SPINE INDICATION: Fall from feet with fractured spine. TECHNIQUE: Cervical spine imaging was performed with sagittal T, T, gradient echo, and inversion recovery scans as well as axial T-weighted images. Comparison is made to the cervical spine CT performed on . Thoracic spine imaging was performed with sagittal T, T and inversion recovery scans as well as axial T-weighted images. Comparison is made to the thoracic spine CT from . FINDINGS: CERVICAL SPINE: Images of the cervical spine are limited by motion artifact. However, there is clearly evidence of increased T signal in the posterior spinal musculature, consistent with edema associated with injury. A mild degree of prevertebral edema is also present, especially anterior to the inferior cervical segments. There is slightly increased T signal in the C and C vertebral bodies. Posterior element fractures in these locations were identified on CT. There is also protrusion of the C- and C- discs. In the axial and sagittal planes, these disc protrusions result in moderate spinal canal stenosis. There is no clear evidence of cord compression. Gradient echo images show no evidence of susceptibility artifact within the spinal cord or canal to indicate the presence of blood products. IMPRESSION: Cervical spine injury with soft tissue edema in the prevertebral space and posterior cervical musculature. There is suspicion of bony injury of C and C as the vertebral bodies are slightly T hyperintense. Fractures of the posterior elements of these vertebral segments were identified on CT. There is spinal canal narrowing due to disc protrusions at C- and C-, but there is no cord compression at this time. CHEST (PORTABLE AP : AM CHEST (PORTABLE AP Reason: interval change MEDICAL CONDITION: year old man s/p trach REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: interval change AP CHEST : A.M. HISTORY: Tracheostomy tube placement. IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to and th: Small right pleural effusion and minimal pulmonary edema have decreased. Left lower lobe remains collapsed. Tip of the tracheostomy tube abuts the left wall of the trachea, probably a function of the orientation of ventilator tubing. Heart is normal size, mediastinum remains shifted to the left. Right subclavian line tip projects over the SVC. Right pleural tube has been removed. No pneumothorax. Brief Hospital Course: Patient admitted to the trauma service; transferred to the TSICU. He received TD/Solu-Medrol in the trauma bay. Orthopedic Spine was immediately consulted due to his spine injuries. He was taken to the operating room for spine fusion. Patient later fitted for a TLSO brace which must be worn while OOB. He will need to follow up with Dr. in weeks after discharge from hospital. Patient was difficult to wean from ventilator and had actually failed extubation trial requiring re-intubation. A Tracheostomy was placed on along with a PEG, both without complication on. Speech and Swallow evaluated patient for Passy-Muir valve; his Trach was down sized to Portex on without complication. Vascular surgery consulted forC filter placement; this was placed on . Infectious disease was consulted because of persistent fevers; Bronch/BAC MRSA; aspiration pneumonia by CXR. has recommended that he continue on Vanco and Ceftazidime; both will need to continue through ; and to continue with Flagyl for another days. If patient re-spikes it has been recommended to re-culture at that time. Physical and Occupational therapy have been working with patient closely during his hospitalization.

Collapse of RML and RLL airway collapse noted at OSH, and bronch performed showed severe tracheobronchialmalacia of primary distal trachea and right main stem > left main stem bronchi. Stenting attempted on was unsuccessful due to pt's inability to extend his C-spine well. Heavy bleeding post procedure & a second bronch was performed to suction the airways. Pt remained stable after teh second bronch. Patient was transitioned to trach mask on without problems. Prolonged discussions with patient re: risks and benefits of stent placment included discussion about ease of stent placement but difficulty of stent removal if necessary given difficult upper-airway anatomy. Pt is a poor surgical candidate for surgical correction of the tracheobronchomalacia with tracheoplasty. As such, it was decided to wean him to a trach collar and proceed with downsizing the trach as able.

Then, at that point, it was discovered that ten years ago she was diagnosed with angiomyolipoma, however, she had been asymptomatic until this day, . She was subsequently brought to for further care. She has no history of any renal procedures or surgeries. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS: Metformin b.i.d., verapamil t.i.d., sulfazine b.i.d., mg aspirin daily, and ibuprofen mg b.i.d. to t.i.d. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes mellitus type , hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Hernia repair and appendectomy when she was approximately years old. SOCIAL HISTORY: No history of smoking or heavy drinking. FAMILY HISTORY: Her mother died of ovarian cancer. INPATIENT MEDICATIONS: Acetaminophen to p.o. q.- hours p.r.n., captopril mg t.i.d., famotidine p.o. b.i.d., furosemide mg p.o. b.i.d., insulin sliding scale, morphine - mg q. hours p.r.n. pain, oxycodone mg p.o. q. hours. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted on , and she was taken to the surgical ICU where she was transfused units. Her angiomyolipoma was embolized on . Subsequently the next morning, she began to experience desaturations and complained of chest pain. A CTA and chest- ray showed signs of CHF. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm and she was given of hydralazine as well as Lasix. She subsequently stabilized and was transferred to the floor on . While she was on the floor, her blood pressure continued to remain elevated. A medicine consult was obtained and she was also maintained on hydralazine and p.o. of Lasix per medicine's recommendations. Her hydralazine was used only in cases of elevated blood pressure when the Lasix and her verapamil did not decrease her systolic blood pressure to less than . Throughout her hospital stay, her verapamil was discontinued and she was begun on . mg of captopril p.o. t.i.d. She was ruled out for a myocardial infarction by having negative cardiac enzymes and negative CK MB and negative troponin. A repeat EKG was also normal. An echocardiogram was obtained on her third postoperative day, sixth hospital day, and that was negative. A stress test was also obtained days later and that was also negative for any heart disease. Her postoperative course remained uncomplicated. Her blood cultures, urine cultures showed no growth through her day of discharge and she had mild fevers which was expected secondary to her embolization procedure. She was discharged on hospital day eight, postprocedure day , in good condition. She was sent home with her captopril, her oxycodone mg and her Cipro b.i.d. for days. She was also instructed to visit her family physician prior to coming to the hospital for procedure for radical right nephrectomy so that her primary care physician was aware of her new blood pressure medication and changes.

Psychiatry was consulted to assess mental status and manage behavior finding that her signs and symptoms are most consistent with a organic syndrome relating to her brain injury, with resolving toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. While her untreated bipolar disorder may be contributing somewhat to her mood lability, it is unlikely to be the primary cause of her symptoms. Neurology was consulted to evaluate confusion and odd behavior finding that the most likely cause of these signs and symptoms was a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy that will simply clear with time but additonally recommeded limiting sedating mediations.

Respiratory failure/Pneumonia -- Likely a multifactorial problem, including CHF decompensation, pneumonia (GPC in chains at OSH, presumes streptococcus, and COPD. Wheezes on exam, but not really responsive to bronchodilators. Pt was intubated on day of admission with respiratory distress. Initial CXR was read as: ""there is substantial real mediastinal widening, but whether this is due to vascular engorgement alone or a combination of vascular engorgement and adenopathy is difficult to assess. In addition to interstitial abnormality throughout the lungs most likely edema. There are more focal areas of consolidation predominantly in the left suprahilar and basal lung concerning for pneumonia."" Despite all initial micro data being negative, he was continued on Vancomycin ( days total, Azithromycin (total days given and Ceftriaxone ( days started on the day of admission. In addition, on , he was started on Hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency. He was volume overloaded on exam and diuresed daily. CT chest on revealed: ""IMPRESSION: . Findings consistent with background pulmonary edema. . Partial consolidations in the right upper and lower lobes, and increased ground-glass in the left upper lobe. Findings most likely relate to multifocal pneumonia. . Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left."" During this time, attempts to wean were unsuccessful with high RISBs and agitation if not sedated. Bronchoscopy performed on revelaed a clear L side and R sided secretions. Micro data from the BAL was positive for MRSA. Vanc and Zosyn ( days given were restarted on for continued secretions and inability to wean. He underwent trach on without event. RISB data was as high as s at this time. PS trials were not successful. On , pt spiked fever to . Secretions increased but micro data revealed only MRSA with blood and urine Cx negative. Ct chest on revealed: ""There is interval decrease in bilateral pleural effusions. There is also improvement in the right upper lobe atelectasis. There are persistent partial atelectasis of the lower lobes likely due to associated pleural effusion. There is also interval improvement in the ground-glass opacities likely due to pulmonary edema. IMPRESSION: . Interval improvement in pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and atelectasis. . Cardiomegaly. . Calcifications of the right coronary artery. . Smallount of ascites."" Vanco was stopped on the s/p > weeks of coverage. Throughout this time, he retained a good amount of fluid and daily lasix was required to diurese him and prevent effusions. All remaining micro data yielded only MRSA in the sputum. For increased secretions and elevated temperature, he was restarted on Vancomycin on per with a goal of a day course. CT sinus done on to rule out sinusitis revealed: ""IMPRESSION: Mild mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses and sphenoid sinus. Partial opacification in the mastoid air cells bilaterally."" By day of discharge, secretions are improved and pt feels significantly better. He has been out of bed to the chair for over a week. He had good urine output. He is afebrile days. The goal is to discharge to rehab for eventual wean from trach. . Pt initially hypotensive but eventuall hypertensive and thus started on ACE inhibitor. Initially this was Captopril but pt developed a rash and peripheral eosinophilia after days and was switched per pharm recommendations to Lisinopril. The rash subsequently resolved and the BP is well controlled at time of discharge. . CHF -- Pt with CT consistent with PNA on admission.

Relative increased ground-glass opacity is also seen in the left upper lobe. There are bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left. Mediastinal lipomatosis is present, accounting for wide appearance of the mediastinum on plain film-ray. ET tube is in good position. There are multiple mediastinal but non-enlarged lymph nodes. Anasarca within the right thoracic subcutaneous soft tissues is noted. NG tube is seen coiled within the stomach. Imaged upper abdomen is otherwise normal. No suspicious bone lesions are seen. Heart is mildly enlarged. Great vessels are unremarkable. Right internal jugular central venous line has its tip in the distal SVC. IMPRESSION: . Findings consistent with background pulmonary edema. . Partial consolidations in the right upper and lower lobes, and increased ground-glass in the left upper lobe. Findings most likely relate to multifocal pneumonia. . Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left. . CT Chest FINDINGS: There is interval decrease in bilateral pleural effusions. There is also improvement in the right upper lobe atelectasis. There are persistent partial atelectasis of the lower lobes likely due to associated pleural effusion. There is also interval improvement in the ground-glass opacities likely due to pulmonary edema. Pleural effusions are now small-to-moderate. Mediastinal lipomatosis and multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes are not changed when compared to the prior study and do not meet CT criteria for pathology. The heart and great vessels are unchanged when compared to prior study. Again noted calcifications of the right coronary artery. The ET tube is in good position. Limited images of the upper abdomen reveal a smallount of ascites around the liver and spleen. There is a left subclavian central line with the tip in the distal left brachiocephalic vein. The heart remains slightly enlarged. There is a G-tube within the stomach. Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. IMPRESSION: . Interval improvement in pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and atelectasis. . Cardiomegaly. . Calcifications of the right coronary artery. . Smallount of ascites. . Ct Sinus NON-CONTRAST SINUS CT: The frontal sinuses are clear. Mild mucosal thickening is present in both maxillary sinuses. A small mucosal retention cyst is present within the floor of the left maxillary sinus. Polypoid area of mucosal thickening is present within a left sphenoid air cell. The remainder of the sphenoid air cells and ethmoid air cells are clear. The reconstructed images are of limited resolution, precluding assessment of the ostiomeatal complexes. The ethmoid roofs and cribriform plates are level. The main sphenoid septum inserts just to the left of midline. There is pneumatization of the left optic strut but no pneumatization of the anterior clinoid processes. Lamina papyracea appears intact bilaterally. The nasal septum is unremarkable. Note is made of scattered opacification in the mastoid air cells. IMPRESSION: Mild mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses and sphenoid sinus. Partial opacification in the mastoid air cells bilaterally. . ECHO . The left atrium is mildly dilated. . Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>%.

The patient underwent CT torso in the ED given her history of known right main pulmonary artery invasion from the tumor. However, no gross hemorrhage was seen in the chest cavity. Additionally, she was continued on folic acid as an adjuct to her chemotherapy regimen. She is to follow-up with her oncologist. . Pulmonary Embolisms: Last documented in , was on coumadin on presentation. Given her significant GI bleed, coumadin was stopped (and its effects reversed with FFP and a decision was made to stop anticoagulation henceforth. Per primary oncology team, the patient's history of PE was related to tumor compression of the pulmonary vasculature, and therefore there is no clear indication for anticoagulation in the future. . Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor: S/p resection in without known recurrence, but suspicious lesion was seen on EGD. The patient was advised to undergo repeat EGD in weeks for biopsy of gastric lesion. Also suggested outpatient colonoscopy. . Hypothyroidism: S/p thyroid resection for adenoma. Continued on home levothyroxine. . Hypokalemia: Likely secondary to severe diarrhea. Resolved with fluid resuscitation. . Lower Extremity Edema: Likely secondary to chemotherapy vs. venous stasis. Intially held home lasix due to risk of hemodynamic compromise, but restarted after fluid resuscitation. . Leukopenia and Thrombocytopenia: Decreased platelets could be consumptive process in setting of recent bleed but more likely related to recent chemotherapy administration.

Brief Hospital Course: . : (reiteration of course until transfer to floor: Pt was admitted, cultures taken and pt put on vancomycin, levaquin, and flagyl. He had a CT scan of his lower extremity, which revealed subcutaneous collections with enhancing rims involving the dorsum of the foot, and the medial and lateral ankles which are quite extensive in length. He was taken to the OR on where his wound was again debrided. They also placed VAC dressing at this time. Podiatry performed a split thickness skin graft on (R thigh to R foot. On he was transferred to the MICU for hypotension ('s/'s and fevers up to after his split thickness skin graft procedure. His lactate was . and he was tachycardic so he was placed on the sepsis protocol. He was fluid rescusitated and his BP quickly improved to -/-. He developed diarrhea on . Given that he had been on clindamycin for treatment of his foot infection, it was felt that he likely had C Diff and was begun on po flagyl. He was also empirically placed back on vancomycin and levaquin, as his only culture that was positive was a wound swab from admission that grew coag negative staph (rare; no sensitivities performed. On / he was transferred to the floor. His problem on the floor was persistent hypotension in the s-s. He was asymptomatic throughout. His blood pressure would bump occasionally with fluid boluses, but eventually these were stopped because his hypotension was asymptomatic and he would just diurese all of the fluid on his own. He initially was febrile and tachycardic with these low blood pressures, but both of those resolved and his BP remained low. He had numerous studies in terms of an infectious workup, including numerous negative CXR's, blood cultures, stools cultures (including CDiff neg, rd pending to date, and negative urine cultures - although he did have one urine cx with E.coli that was felt by to not be the source of his fevers, as on repeat UA it was negative. He did receive a couple doses of Macrobid for this UTI. At one point his left knee was mildly swollen, and a tap of this effusion revealed normal joint fluid with no evidence of infection. He was discharged home to finish one more week of vancomycin and on d/c he had been afebrile days. His levaquin and flagyl were discontinued as no source was identified. . Hyperthermia, resolved. Although this occurred directly after his operation, it was felt not to be due to malignant hyperthermia but was related to infection. . Cardiac hx: He had a reported history of CHF, but had an Echo that was essentially normal with an EFof %. He did not develop any pulmonary edema or lower extremity edema with the IVF he received. It was not felt that his hypotension was cardiogenic in origin given his EF. He had a normal EKG and cardiac enzymes were all negative in the setting of his tachycardia (mildly elevated CK but negative MB and negative troponins. . s/p R foot debridement: Followed by Podiatry. Wound instructions as per d/c instructions. He will follow up in Podiatry on the th. His wound looked excellent per them. . GI: His diarrhea was initially trace guaiac positive with a subsequent Hct drop, as low as . This was felt to possibly be dilutional secondary to his fluid resuscitation.

ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Final : Mixed bacterial flora-culture screened for B. fragilis, C. perfringens, and C. septicum. None isolated. The patient had a a fever workup, including two sets of blood cultures, urine and sputum cultures, C. diff screening and CXR, completed due to persistant low-grade fevers following marked improvement of his odontogenic abscess and no evidence of further fascial space collections. At time of discharge, all were unremarkable or not yet read. Brief Hospital Course: Dr. was taken immediately to the OR from the ED where the above noted procedure was carried out. -ml of malodorous, thick purulence was drained from the right submandibular and lateral pharyngeal spaces. Due to concern over airway edema, the patient was left intubated postoperatively. After an unremarkable stay in the PACU while awaiting an ICU bed, the patient was transferred to the neuro ICU. He remained stable on postoperative days and , with resolving white count. On a postoperative CT was completed which demonstrated no drainable collections and the intra/extraoral drains in good position. The patient was still noted to have signficant airway edema so the decision was made to keep him intubated another hrs. On , a leak-test demonstrated that the patient had had enough pharyngeal edema resolution to keep a patent airway. The patient was successfully extubated on and remained in the ICU for observation. On , a follow-up CT demonstrated that the patient continued to be free of drainable collections though he was noted to have findings consistent with an acute sinusitis of the left maxilla, likely secondary to nasal intubation. The patient once again had a small bump in his WBC and continued to have low-grade fevers, therefor a fever workup was completed including blood, urine and sputum cultures. A CXR was unremarkable. Over the next two days, the patient continued to demonstrate improvement in his swelling and constitutional signs and had his drains pulled and was discharged to home on in good condition.

CXR Right IJ central venous catheter tip in the expected location of the cavoatrial junction. Low lung volumes limit evaluation. Left basilar atelectasis, mild CHF. Widened appearance of the mediastinum for which clinical correlation is advised. --- As compared to the previous examination, there is marked improvement of the chest radiograph. The size of the cardiac silhouette has decreased, the lung volumes have increased. The preexisting evidence of overhydration has markedly decreased, although the aspect of the hilar structures still suggests minimal remnant central edema. There also is a marked decrease of the pre-existing predominantly left mid lung and right basal areas of atelectasis. There is no evidence of pleural effusion. No focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia. Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, the central venous catheter is unchanged in position. --- Comparison is made to the prior day. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There are areas of minor atelectasis at the lung bases associated with low lung volumes, but no congestive heart failure, pleural effusion or pneumothorax ECHO The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The estimated right atrial pressure is - mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >%. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<mmHg. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets ( are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function. Mildy dilated right ventricle with normal systolic function. Brief Hospital Course: In brief this is a year old female with HTN, hyperlipidemia who was admited to MICU with diarrhea, altered mental status, platelet count of , ARF, hypotension, CT finding concerning for PNA as well as UA concerning for UTI. She has been doing well in the MICU and is transfered to the floor, with improved mental status, resolved hypotension, improved ARF and currently being treated for PNA and UTI with levofloxacin and being followed by hematology for TCP. Diarrhea: Most likely this was the precipitant for hypovolemia. Stool cultures were negative. Most likely etiology is viral gastroenterits. Resolved during hospitalization. Hypotension: She was noted to have E Coli bacteremia on OSH. Most likely source is urine, given UA finding concerning for UTI. She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics on presentation which were consolidated to levofloxacin. She was discharged on a day course of this medication. Initially treated with levophed andF. The patient was able to mantain normal BP after these interventions were discontinued. She was monitored for several days without complications. Her atenolol was held and can be restarted on an outpatient basis. Altered mental status: Most likely related to hypovolemia and or infective illness. Head CT negative. This resolved with correction of BP and antibiotic therapy. ARF: FeNa consistent with volume depletion. Fluid responsive and returned to baseline withF. On presentation she had AGMA; notably AG closed withF but HCO continued to decrease. This suggests a NAGMA which most likely was related to the diarrhea. As the diarrhea improved the HCO returned to level. Thrombocytopenia (TCP: Differential included ITP (but no large platelets on smear, vitamin deficiency (B/folate were normal or viral infection-related process (but EBV and CMV were positive for chronic but not acute infection, . Other etiologies such as as drug-induced processes were considered. She has been taking prilosec (although it is not clear if the onset of prilosec fits with the development of TCP. Prilosec was discontinued.S is a remote possibility as well. She received one platelet transfusion and her platelet count increased through the hospitalization. The patient was refered to outpatient hematology for further work up. Mild transaminitis: Followuing her hypotension she developed mild transaminits which was attributed to hepatic hypoperfusion. These improved following restoration of blood pressure. Her statin was held and can be restarted as outpatient. If her transaminases remain elevated she may require further work up.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: -pericardiocentesis in cardiac catheterization laboratory on -Classical Caesarian section on History of Present Illness: The pt is a year-old GP female at wks who initially presented to an OSH complaining of fever and pleuritic chest pain. Five days PTA, the pt developed onset of substernal chest pain while sitting. She rated the intensity of the pain as a , radiating to L arm. She added that the pain got steadily worse over the next several days. She noted that the pain was exacerbated by exertion. She also developed fevers to -, and shortness of breath over the days prior to admission. She was recently seen in OSH ED with complaints of fever, and was admitted to an OSH from when she presented again with fever, weakness, pleuritic cp, and tachycardia at which time she underwent suboptimal CTA (problem with contrast bolus and nuclear perfusion scan (ventilation portion not performed which was read as normal. On the day of admission at the outside ED, she was noted to be tachycardic to , saturating % on L O via nasal cannula. Blood cultures were drawn, and she was started on a heparin drip over the concern for pulmonary embolus. On presentation to , she denied dysuria, urinary frequency, hematuria, abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, BRBPR, contractions, vaginal bleeding or spotting, rashes, or skin breakdown. She did admit to recent onset of right knee pain and swelling following syncopal episode weeks PTA, but did not notice pain until five days PTA. There was no previous history of joint or muscle pain. She also complained of orthopnea and PND but denied any increased lower extremity edema. She also complained of a sore throat that began five days PTA.

ECG: , st elev I,II,III, F, V, V, V, V V, V, std aVR, Qw,III,F Brief Hospital Course: Pericarditis: The pt's. symptoms and EKG findings were suggestive of pericarditis. As she also presented with fever and leukocytosis with bandemia, she was empirically started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin on admission for a possible infectious etiology. Given the constellation of the pt's symptoms, a rheumatologic cause was also in the differential and a number of serologic tests were sent (all of which eventually returned negative. On the morning of the second hospital day, an echocardiogram was performed which revealed a large pericardial effusion. She was started on indomethacin. A central venous catheter was inserted and a Swan-Ganz catheter was floated. This revealed tamponade physiology. Therefore, the pt. was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab where she underwent fluoroscopically guided pericardiocentesis. The pt. tolerated the procedure well and approximately ccs of viscous yellow fluid was drained. A drain was left in place for hours which drained approximately more cc of serosanguinous fluid. The fluid was sent for gram stain as well as bacterial, fungal, viral and acid fast cultures. On HD , the pericardial fluid grew out albicans, at which time the pt. was started onbisome. Numerous repeat echocardiograms were performed over the course of the next week and a half to assess for reaccumulation of the pericardial fluid given the pt's. persistent tachycardia and hypoxia. None of these studies revealed reaccumulation. On HD , the pt. was started on steroids as indomethacin was discontinued secondary to ARF. The pt. reported dramatic improvement in her chest pain on steroids. She was eventually transitioned to a slow p.o. steroid taper. The service had recommended treating possible infectious causes with a week course of ceftriaxone and a week course ofbisome. The patient was then changed to fluconazle to complete a week course. She will be discharged on fluconazole to followup in clinic. She should take more days of prednisone mg/ day upon discharge. Fever/Leukocytosis: The pt. was noted to have a low-grade fever on admission, but defervesced shortly after admission after initiation of treatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. She began to spike fevers again days into her hospital stay after her caesarian section. All of the pt's. indwelling lines were removed and sent for culture. vancomycin was empirically begun for empiric treatment. Blood cultures eventually grew out coagulase negative staph. She was treated with a total of a day course. Hypoxia: The pt. was noted to be hypoxic on admission. A CTA was performed which was not suggestive of pulmonary embolus. She consistently required oxygen by nasal cannula and, at times, facemask. Her arterial blood gases showed both hypercarbia and hypoxemia. It was thought that her hypoxia was secondary to splinting from chest pain, atelectasis and a component of CHF. After delivery of her baby, the pt's. O requirements decreased and the pt. was noted to be less tachypneic and saturating well with minimal O via nasal cannula. Right knee effusion: The pt. was noted to have an effusion of her right knee on admission. It was tapped by the rheumatology service on the night of admission. The fluid was sent for gram stain and culture which was unrevealing. The knee was re-tapped for reaccumulation of fluid on HD . Anray was performed to rule out fracture given the history of fall and was negative. The swelling eventually subsided and no further intervention was undertaken. Pregnancy: The maternal and fetal medicine service as intimately involved with the pt's. care throughout her MICU stay. They monitored the fetus daily with ultrasound and nonstress tests, all of which showed reassuring fetal status. On HD , after concern over the possible development of preeclamsia secondary to mild epigastric discomfort and rising LFTs, an elective Caesarian section was performed. The pt. tolerated the procedure well and delivered a healthy boy who was immediately transferred to the NICU. Acute renal failure: On HD , the pt. was noted to be in oliguric renal failure, thought to be secondary to both prerenal and intrinsic renal (ATN components. She was placed on a lasix drip for days and was also fluid resuscitated. In addition, all nephrotoxic agents including indomethacin were discontinued. Her urine output and serum creatinine improved by HD and the lasix drip was discontinued. Her renal function remained stable for the duration of her hospital stay. Anemia: The pt. was noted to have a low hematocrit on admission. Iron studies, B and folate levels and hemolysis labs were sent. This workup was consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation. She was transfused a total of units of PRBCs over the course of HD to keep her hematocrit above in light of her pregnancy. Her hematocrit remained within the - range for the remainder of the hospital stay, and she required no further transfusions. Steroid-induced hyperglycemia: The pt. was noted to have very elevated serum and fingerstick glucose levels after the initiation of steroid treatment for pericarditis (which was further complicated by pregnancy. She was treated with an insulin drip with success. After tapering of her steroid dose, her insulin requirements decreased and she was transitioned to a sliding scale of regular subcutaneous insulin. On day of discharge her hyperglycemia had mainly resolved and she not discharged on insulin. F/E/N. Poor PO intake secondary to anorexia. Patient received boost supplements. Additionally, she had a large potassium requirement (meq/day and large magnesium requirement (mg/day thought secondary to poor PO intake and effects ofbisome. She was discharged on multivitamin, potassium, and magnesium supplements and should continue to supplement her diet with shakes. Medications on Admission: -celexa -singulair Discharge Medications: .

The heart, pericardium and great vessels are unremarkable. There are no pleural or pericardial effusions. The lung window images reveal bibasilar atelectasis. No lung nodules or opacities are visualized. The airways appear patent to the level of segmental bronchi bilaterally. CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: A well-circumscribed hyperattenuating mass in the mesentery. This is not typical for a hematoma. However, in the setting of trauma this is a consideration. Other differentials include mesenchymal mass or enhancing lymph node. Lymphoma can be a consideration. FACIAL BONE CT: There are multiple facial bone fractures. These include anterior and lateral wall fractures of the maxillary sinuses bilaterally. The right fracture fragments are displaced, some into the sinus cavity. Lamina papyrecea and lateral orbital wall fractures are also noted bilaterally. There are fractures through the inferior orbital rims and orbital floors, but no herniation of orbital contents. There is a fracture through the right orbital roof, with fragements inferiorly displaced. Fractures through the fovea ethmoidalis and both anterior and posterior walls of the frontal sinus are also identified. There is a fracture separating the inferior frontal and nasal bones. There is orbital emphysema. There is no evidence of muscular impingement, and the optic nerves and globes appear normal. The anterior clinoids are intact. There is a small hematoma lateral to the left lateral rectus muscle. There is a fracture through the right zygomatic arch and there is a fracture of the body of the left zygoma, at the inferolateral aspect of the orbital rim. There are fractures of the pterygoid plates. Fluid levels are visualized in the sphenoid sinus, frontal and ethmoid air cells. Subcutaneous air is seen anterior to the right maxillary sinus and lateral to the left maxillary sinus. Mandibles are intact. Bilateral skull fractures are also noted invloving the temporal bones. IMPRESSION: Multiple facial bone and orbital fractures, as described. CT head without contrast: There is bilateral subdural hemorrhage anterior to the temporal lobes. Air is also seen in the left middle cranial fossa, anterior to the temporal lobe, and along the inner table of the right frontal skull. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is also seen on the left, particularly in the Sylvian fissure. There is possible subdural hemorrhage adjacent to the right frontal lobe. Brain parenchymal attenuation is preserved. There is no shift of normally midline structures or major vascular territory infarction. There is no evidence of hydrocephalus. There are multiple skull and facial bone fractures seen. There are a few fracture lines through the right temporal bone, involving squamous and mastoid portions. The fracture extends across the epitymapanic cavity and there is fluid in the dependent portion of the middle ear. There is left temporal squamous fracture. The mastoid air cells are intact. There are fractures of the maxillary sinuses, ethmoids and lamina papyrecea, and lateral orbital walls. There is probably some hematoma in the orbits, adjacent to fractured walls, but no major displacement of the orbital structures is evident. The globes are intact. Fractures through the zygomatic bones bilaterally are also noted. Air- fluid levels are seen in the sphenoid sinus, ethmoid air cells and the frontal sinus. IMPRESSION: Subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage as described above with multiple skull and facial fractures. CT C-SPINE: No evidence of cervical spine fracture, however, there is widening of the C- facet joints and ther could be ligamentous injury. Follow-up flexion-extension study, or if the patient is unable, an MR scan should be considered if there are clinical signs of cervical injury. CHEST, AP SUPINEEW: The heart is normal in size. There is apparent widening of the mediastinum, which may be due to supine positioning. Low lung volumes are present bilaterally. There are no pleural effusions, focal consolidations, or pneumothorax demonstrated. There is no overt evidence of pulmonary vascular engorgement. An old left posterior rd rib fracture is present. PELVIS, AP SUPINEEW: No fracture, dislocation, or degenerative changes are identified. Pubic symphysis, both hips, and sacroiliac joints appear preserved. Sacral struts are intact. Overlying trauma board limits complete evaluation in the pelvis. No soft tissue calcifications or masses are present. IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the bilateral subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages, with interval resorption of the frontal pneumocephalus. No interval progression of mass effect or shift of normally midline structures. Stable appearance of multiple facial fractures. Brief Hospital Course: The patient was stabilized in the Emergency Department where he was hemodynamically stable and protecting his airway, he was taken to the CT scanner (results above. Anesthesia evaluated him in CT scan, and decided to take him to the OR for definitive management of his airway. There, ENT plerformed an open tracheostomy. The patient was transferred to the SICU on the ventilator. OMFS evaluated him on admission for his LeFort facial fracture. Neurosurgery was consulted for his SDH, SAH. He was started on Dilantin. Opthomology evaluated him for his orbital floor fractures - no evidence of entrapment. He was monitored & stabilized in the Trauma-SICU. On HD , he went to the OR with OMFS for plating of his facial fractures. He tolerated the procedure well and was weaned off the vent on HD. On HD he was transferred to the floor. His serial CT scans showed satisfactory plating and alignment of his facial fractures and stable appearance of his subdural hematomas. On the floor, he was started on soft solids which he tolerated well. His trach was capped on HD, and he tolerated this well. He was evaluated by plastics/hand on HD & found to have left thumb fractures ( & skiiers fx. A thumb spica splint was applied & he will have these repaired as an outpatient week after discharge. On HD, he was evaluated by neurobehavioral & psychiatric consult services for increasing agitation. He was started on haloperidol as needed for agitation and a standing dose of mg T, which was constinued through discharge. He required : sitters for agitation, especially at night, but these were discontinued days prior to discharge due to improvements in his mental status. On HD his trach was decanuated by ORL, and he tolerated this well. His trach site was dressed with a dry sterile dressing. During this hospitalization, he was started on prednisone secondary to his injury. This was tapered & his taper will be complete approximately week after discharge. He was evaluated by PT/OT and he made good progress, by the time of discharge, he wasbulating without difficulty or assitance. He was tolerating a regular diet without difficulty.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: None. ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: After the patient was extubated and communicative, it is apparent that he is homeless and lives on the streets. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Examination revealed the following: VITAL SIGNS: Pulse , blood pressure /palpation, respirations saturating, % on arrival. The patient is combative, but moves all four extremities. HEENT: Equal and reactive pupils. GCS: . Neck was supple. There were no stepoffs. He has crepitus over the left chest wall and he has a stab wound approximately -cm wide in the left mid-axillary wall below the nipple line. ABDOMEN: Soft, without guarding and mildly distended. EXTREMITIES: No obvious deformities. He has palpable pulses distally. RECTAL: Examination is guaiac negative with normal tone. LABORATORY DATA: Labs studies revealed the following: White count ., hematocrit , platelet count ,. Electrolytes: sodium , potassium ., chloride , bicarbonate , BUN , creatinine ., glucose , PT ., PTT , INR .,ylase , toxicology screen positive for opiates, fibrinogen , lactate .. RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES: CT of the head showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. CT of the chest upon arrival showed no injury to the great vessels or the pericardium. There is a left lateral lower chest-wall hematoma. There was a small pneumothorax, anteromedial portion of the left chest. There was some subcutaneous emphysema of the left chest. CT of the abdomen, upon arrival, showed no injury to the solid organs. CT of the abdomen, PO and contrast, repeated on hospital day , shows no evidence of injury to the solid organs or viscera. There is no peritoneal free air. Cervical spine films with three views show normal cervical spine with some degenerative joint disease. TLS films are negative for fracture. CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. was admitted after acute trauma of the left chest stab wound below the nipple line on the lateral chest. He was admitted to the ICU for ventilatory support and left hemothorax management. Hospital course is described below by systems. . NEUROLOGICAL: Mr. presented with positive alcohol level and he was initially for a few days. He required adjuvant support to prevent any withdrawal. He was eventually extubated without problems. At times, he has been agitated, however, over the progression of his hospital course, he is now alert and oriented times three. He is appropriate at this level. He is currently taking Percocet for pain, however, this can be weaned off as tolerated. . CARDIOVASCULAR: CT scan of the chest shows no injury to his mediastinal vessels. Over the hospital course, Mr. has remained hemodynamically stable. He is on no cardiac medications. . RESPIRATORY: Mr. suffered a wound to his left chest giving him a left hemothorax, which needed evacuation with a left chest tube. This chest tube was weaned over his hospital course and followed up with chest-ray. On discharge, he has some rhonchi on the left side, however, he is able to be comfortable andbulate on the floor on room air. He has two wounds on his left chest; one is original stab wound and one is the chest-tube incision site. Both were draining serosanguinous material, which are being treated with dry dressings as needed. He is expected to resolve this drainage and heal these wounds secondarily without any intervention. He will require aggressive pulmonary toilet with incentive spirometry to facilitate his pulmonary recovery. . GASTROINTESTINAL: Mr. , after being extubated, has been progressed to a regular diet, which he is tolerating without problems. received CT scan of the abdomen with PO and contrast, which showed no apparent injury to solid organs or his bowel. He is now well over the time to have a visceral injury and his examination is benign with a soft abdomen. He is to continue a regular diet. He is being taken off H blockers since he is already on a regular diet. : INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Mr. has no evidence of any infection and he is not on any antibiotics. . HEMATOLOGY: Mr. had normal coagulation studies on admission and he has had stable hematocrit at over the last few days. . PROPHYLAXIS: Mr. has been on heparin subcutaneously prophylaxis during his admission. However, now that he isbulating well, this can be discontinued if he continues tobulate well. . ALCOHOL USE: Mr. was given initially some Ativan as prophylaxis to treat any history of alcohol use. He is off this now and he will need counseling to keep him away from any substance abuse. He was given a nicotine patch to suppress his urge for smoking. . RENAL: Mr. is able to void spontaneously and he has had adequate urine output throughout his admission. . WOUND CARE: Wound care is as described under the respiratory section. He will need dry dressings p.r.n. until the drainage stops. SUMMARY: In summary, Mr. was brought to with chest wound, post stabbing. He has required initial intubation and ventilatory support. However, he was easily extubated after his wound was found to not have caused any injury to his major vessels or abdominal viscera. He has an injury to his lung, which caused hemothorax, which has now resolved and he currently has two small wounds on his chest, secondary to his stabbing and his chest tube. These wounds required local care. On discharge, he is able tobulate, tolerate regular diet. He is voiding spontaneously and he is having bowel movements. He is on Percocet for pain. He will followup with the trauma clinic in two weeks for routine followup. FOLLOW-UP CARE: The patient will followup in the trauma clinic in two weeks. : . DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: .
