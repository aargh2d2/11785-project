CXR: : As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Lung volumes have minimally decreased. The pre-existing massive bilateral parenchymal opacities, predominating at the right lung base and the left lung apex are unchanged. Also unchanged is the accompanying right basal pleural effusion. Traces of gas in the right lateral soft tissues have completely resolved. There is no evidence of newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities. Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. : There is a subsequent increase in severity of the pre-existing massive parenchymal opacities, predominating at the left lung apex and the right lung base. No opacities have newly appeared. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Slightly decreasing is the large right lateral chest wall air inclusion. Chest CT: . Status post right lower lobe lobectomy and right upper lobe posterior segmentectomy. . Acute pulmonary embolism originating at the ligated right lower lobe pulmonary artery extending into the right middle lobe pulmonary artery. . Diffuse bilateral honeycombing which is new since . . Right hydropneumothorax and pneumothorax. . Right-sided subcutaneous edema. Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF % secondary to hypokinesis of the basal inferior septum, akinesis of the basal inferior free wall, and dyskinesis of the basal posterior wall. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets ( appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. Brief Hospital Course: Mr. was taken to the operating room on by Dr. for right thoracoscopy, right thoracotomy and right lower lobectomy with en bloc right upper lobe posterior segmentectomy, mediastinal lymph node dissection, and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, for a right upper lobe mass. The patient recovered in the PACU, extubated, on nasal cannula, with fluid and PCA dilaudid for pain, along with foley catheter and right chest tube to water seal with intermittent leak. He was transferred to in stable condition. Neuro: The patient was initially on dilaudid PCA for pain which was transitioned to oral tylenol, dilaudid, tizanidine. He required medicine for breakthrough, including toradol on POD . On POD , tizandine was increased but stopped secondary to hypotension and dilaudid changed to oxycodone with good control. Over the course of his stay his pain medication was titrated and he was discharged on oxycodone and acetaminophen. Pulmonary: Serial chestrays were done. The chest tube was discontinued POD. Aggressive pulmonary toilet with nebulizers and mucolytics along with lasix, were continued for lung opacification which had appearance of infection vs. inflammation. Despite optimum medical management on the floor the patient became increasingly hypoxic and confused on . He developed respiratory failure with oxygen saturations of % L NC. A CTA revealed right middle lobe pulmonary embolus. Heparin drip was started. He was transferred to the ICU for further management and observation.

MRI with diffusion-weighted images more sensitive in the evaluation for acute ischemia/infarct. CXR: Lungs are much lower in volume, accounting for some interval increase in heart size. The azygos vein is distended and there is a suggestion of mild edema in the right lung, but the combination of hypotension and large heart raises concern for pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. Lateral aspect of the left chest is excluded from the examination. Other pleural surfaces give no indication of pneumothorax. Brief Hospital Course: M hep C cirrhosis, smoldering myeloma, here with catastrophic metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to renal failure and sepsis. * Goals of care: On arrival to MICU, discussed with wife. Pt would wish to have death with dignity, therefore, it was decided that labs would be drawn to determine if pt had further decompensated despite full aggressive care. If so, would proceed to comfort measures only. In the intervening time, pt was made DNR. * Shock: Most likely secondary to sepsis, secondary to bacterial peritonitis. Volume resuscitated with crystalloid to CVP>. Maxed out on levophed immediately on arrival to MICU and started on neosynephrine with only modest effect. MAPs could not be maintained above . Initially planned to start vasopressing and then dobutamine to maximize cardiac output, however, given above goals of care and discussion with family, no further escalation of care was undertaken. * Acidosis: Most likely secondary to combination of liver, renal failure, and sepsis. Given shock, given twops of bicarb stat, then started bicarb infusion to maximize effect of pressors. * Sepsis: Vanco/levo/flagyl given empirically. Subsequent to death of patient, gram stain of peritoneal fluid was found to contain heavy GNR along with PMNs, suggesting that most likely source of overwhelming sepsis was bacterial peritonitis, although primary reason for this was unclear. On reevaluation of laboratory values, pt was found to have continued profound acidosis, profound coagulopathy, continued failure of gluconeogenesis, other liver dysfunction, as well as rising potassium. Therefore, given continued dismal prognosis and patient's wishes, care was withdrawn. Death was declared at . Medications on Admission: . Furosemide mg . Spironolactone mg . Lactulose ( ML PO T .

CT SPINE : . Pathologic fracture of C vertebral body. Posterior aspect of C likely contacts the spinal cord. If patient can tolerate, MRI of the cervical spineis recommended. Additionally, erosion of the transverse process at this level is present. If indicated, evaluation of the vertebral arteries may be performed with MRA neck or CTA of the neck. . Multiple pulmonary nodules, better evaluated on CT examination dated . . Asymmetry of the paraspinal muscles on the right could indicate additional metastatic disease and/or intramuscular hematoma. . Multiple additional lucencies in the cervical spine concerning for metastatic disease, most notable in the C vertebral body. . MRI SPINE . IMPRESSION: . Metastatic involvement at multiple cervical levels, centered around a C vertebral body which demonstrates compression deformity, and retropulsion due to complete invasion by metastatic tumor. There is associated central canal stenosis, with spinal cord compression, though there is no intrinsic cord abnormality at present. . Metastatic involvement of T, L, and the left iliac bone, with no expansion outside of the bony confines. . Mass in the soft tissues of the posterior neck most consistent with hematoma, which should be correlated linically . LENIs : IMPRESSION: No evidence of right lower extremity DVT. Brief Hospital Course: M withrecently diagnosed NSCLC p/w severe neck pain s/p anterior C- diskectomy with anterior fusion on and posterior fusion , admitted to SICU for difficult airway s/p extubation transferred back to oncology floor for pain control. . Agitation: Delirium was initially thought to be due to large amount of narcotics that patient was recieving in ICU and patient was started on haldol. On the oncology floor, the haldol was initially stopped and the pain regimen was modified but the patient continued to have agitation and restlessness. It was felt that the agitation was most likely secondary to either pain or dyspnea associated with mucus/secretion accumulation. Mental status changes may also be related to prolonged hospitalization/sundowning. The patient's agitation/restlessness tended to improve greatly with prn pain medications and/or suctioning. He was started on prn olanzapine for agitation as well. Vitals overnight were held. Our recommendation is to avoid restraints, hold vitals overnight, provide a bed next to a window if at all possible, use pain medications and suctioning as first line treatment for agitation and to use olanzapine as back-up. . Neck Pain: to cancer mets as well as post-op pain. Neck pain difficult to assess give patient's mental status and language barriers. Palliative care was consulted to determine an appropriate pain regimen. Patient was NPO after failing speech and swallow several times including video swallow evaluation. His pain was managed with a fentanyl patch and SL morphine. Radiation-oncology was consulted for palliative radiation options and the decision was made with the family not to pursue any radiation at this time. . Nutrition: The patient failed speech and swallow in the ICU and was made NPO. A doboff was placed but he pulled it out and the decision was made in conjuction with the family not to pursue another doboff. He failed repeat speech and swallow including video swallow study, which was attributed more to post-op changes/neck swelling rather than mental status. Per speech and swallow, the patient will aspirate if he takes POs but we can make pt comfortable and minimize cough by feeding him thin liquids and pureed solids by spoon. Family meeting was held with medical-oncology team, palliative care, and primary oncologist. Decision was made not to pursue feeding tube at this time. . NSCLC: Biopsy proven on , initially presenting with neck pain and ?pathologic C fracture evaluated by orthopedic surgery. CT chest reveals multiple mets. s/p anterior C- diskectomy with anterior fusion on and posterior fusion . Patient had previously communicated wishes to family that he would not want chemotherapy or radiation. Family meeting was held and the family again stated that they are not interested in chemotherapy or radiation, and would like patient to go to with hospice with primary focus on his comfort and pain control. . PNA: He was started on day cefepime course in SICU for PNA. BAL ctx grew out Moraxella. CXR appeared improved and he completed a day course on . He remained afebrile throughout hospital course. On , however, he had increased secretions that were thick and yellow. CBC showed new leukocytosis. CXR showed: ""As compared to , there is interval improvement of bibasilar aeration but still present bilateral right more than left pleural effusion and right basal opacity, findings that might be representing interval development of new right lower lobe process, but residual findings reflecting the prior process cannot be entirely excluded. No new abnormalities have been demonstrated as compared to multiple prior studies. Bilateral pleural effusion is present, most likely subpulmonic on the right."" Vanc and cefepime were initially started but were discontinued after family meeting as antibiotic treatment not in line with goals of care. . HTN: Has history of HTN. Pt not taking any POs and is not receiving any blood pressure medications given goals of care. BP fluctuates broadly, ranging from SBP -s. . Tachycardia: He became tachycardic in the SICU and was started on metoprolol. HR was regular on the floor. Stopped metoprolol . . Incontinence: likely related to mental status. Urine cx negative.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. was evaluated by the trauma team in the Emergency Room and admitted to the Trauma ICU for pain control and evaluation by the Orthopedic service for multiple fractures. He has chronic back pain and has a morphine pump in place which prompted consultation by the pain service for supplemental medication for pain control. Due to his rib fractures his pain was substantial and additional Morphine was effective. He was able to use his incentive spirometer`but required bronchodilators due to intermittent episodes of wheezing. Following transfer to the Trauma floor he continued aggressive pulmonary toilet but eventually desaturated`and became delirious prompting transfer back to the ICU. He underwent a chest CTA, a duplex scan of both legs and a Head CT all which were negative.``He was a bit hypercarbic with a pCO of and after evaluation by the pain service his Morphine was stopped and his additional pain was controlled with oral oxycodone. His mental status gradually returned to , his pain was controlled and he was transferred back to the Trauma floor. The Orthopedic service followed him daily. His left arm was placed in a dorsal splint and is non weight bearing. His left ankle is in an Aircast boot for a fracture of the lateral malleolus and his right foot is in a surgical boot for his fractures st digit. Both lower extremities are weight bearing as tolerated.`````` The Physical Therapy service evaluated him and felt that due to his multiple injuries and limitations he would benefit from a short term rehab prior to his return home for balance, gait training and increasing endurance. At the time of discharge he was eating well, working with Physical Therapy and having adequate pain control.

Discharge Instructions: * Your car accident caused multiple injuries including fractured ribs and broken bones. * Your injury caused right rib fractures which can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain. * You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and notify your physician. * Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures. In order to decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer times every hour while awake. This will help expand the small airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that pool in the lungs. * You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing. * Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short periods may ease the pain. * Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible. * Do NOT smoke * You need to wear an aircast boot on your left foot and you may weight bear as tolerated. * The splint on your left arm will stay in place until further evaluated by the Orthopedic service. Do not bear weight on that arm. * Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation around your ribs ( crepitus .

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a year-old female with a past medical history remarkable for coronary artery disease, type diabetes and worsening anginal symptoms with cardiac catheterization to find three vessel disease of left anterior descending coronary artery, LCX, right coronary artery. On the patient underwent coronary artery bypass graft times two with left internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to right posterior descending coronary artery (lesser saphenous without complications. Postoperatively, the patient was taken to TSRU for close observation and extubated on postoperative day number one and was saturating well. On postoperative day number two the patient developed acute agitation, which required mg of Haldol to maintain the patient sedated. Because the patient's confusion status correlated well with narcotic administration all narcotics and benzodiazepines were discontinued at this time. A few hours thereafter the patient's confusion status resolved and the patient continued to improve postoperatively. By postoperative day number three the decision was made to transfer the patient to the floor since the patient's mental status had returned back to baseline and no additional Haldol was necessary. Furthermore the patient's Lopressor was initiated successfully maintaining the heart rate at s to s without resulting in significant compromise of the blood pressure. The patient was also restarted on Plavix and Glucotrol along with diet as tolerated. On postoperative day number four the patient was evaluated by physical therapy and was deemed to have achieved level five. Shortly thereafter the patient's cardiac rhythm became irregular and the patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. mg of Lopressor along with total of mg of Amiodarone bolus was administered. Approximately three hours after the atrial fibrillation began rate was controlled and the rhythm spontaneously reverted back to normal sinus. By postoperative day number seven the decision was made to discharge the patient to home in good condition, because the patient had not had any arrhythmias for hours after spontaneously reverting to normal sinus rhythm.

Head CT- stable MRI Brain . No evidence of acute infarct. . Stable left frontoparietal subdural hematoma with stable mass effect and minimal midline shift. Stable subarachnoid hemorrhage involving the left frontal, temporal and parietal lobes. CT head IMPRESSION: . Little change in comparison to the study from yesterday, with stable appearance of left frontoparietal subdural hematoma, with overlying subarachnoid hemorrhage; no new focus of hemorrhage. . No abnormal enhancing foci suggestive of infection. NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is relatively uniform enhancement of the subgaleal scalp, overlying the craniotomy site. This was also present on the MR examination of roughly hours earlier, where no rim-enhancing fluid collection to suggest abscess is seen. This likely represents expected post-operative change, but should be closely correlated with physical examination, as with this imaging appearance, cellulitis cannot be entirely excluded. Brief Hospital Course: Mr. presented and underwent left craniotomy and left burr hole for SDH evacuation. Surgery was without complication but the patient was noted to have significant bleeding/oozing. A subdural drain was left in place. He was extubated and transferred to the ICU for neurological monitoring. Post op head CT revealed good evacuation. A hematology consult was requested for evaluation of his clotting. and they recommended no further work-up. Bleeding was assumed likely secondary to previous coumadin. Serial CT scans of the head demonstrated stable post op pneumocephalus and tiny residual left sdh without siginficant mass effect. On his drain was removed without difficulty. PT/OT were consulted for outpatient disposition and they recommended home with outpatient PT. On he had a right hemiparesis and speech difficulty. His discharge was canceled and he was transferred to the step down unit. There was a question as to if this was a seizure. His exam improved and he had one episode of emesis overnight. As a result of his symptoms a repeat head CT was performed and revealed no new hemorrhage or acute intracranial abnormality. He also underwent MRI which showed no evidence of infarct. CT head with contrast ruled out empyema overnight . His EEG from this day was without seizure activity. He was getting screened for rehab on . He was offered a bed on and was transfered.

Per her family she was in her usual state of health when they last saw her on Sunday morning for breakfast. She did not report a headache or any other symptoms at that time, but per her family is not one to complain. She had a scheduled eye procedure at Eye Associates yesterday morning (. She lives alone and her family did not see her or speak with her that morning, but presume she took a cab to the appointment as she typically does. After the procedure she reportedly became diaphoretic and dizzy with nausea/vomiting and was transported to ED. There she was initially awake and alert, and reported that she had been having headaches since the day before and was not feeling well that morning prior to the procedure. She also complained of dizziness and diffuse abdominal pain, and continued to have nausea with several episodes of vomiting. On exam her pupils were equal and reactive, face was symmetric, no focal weakness. BP on arrival was /; did not receive any intervention. CT head was obtained which revealed a R cerebellar hemorrhage. INR was ., troponin .. Rest of labs wnl. She was given mg vitamin K and u FFP. She then reportedly became more somnolent during evaluation and had multiple episodes of vomiting. She was intubated for airway protection and transferred to for further management. BP on arrival here was /. She was seen by the neurosurgery service in the ED, at which point her exam was limited by sedation but revealed pinpoint pupils, intact brain stem reflexes, purposeful movement of all extremities, and a L upgoing toe. A repeat CT at :pm revealed a . . cm R cerebellar hemorrhage with a smallount of surrounding edema and mild effacement of the fourth ventricle, overall unchanged from her prior CT from :am at . She was admitted to the neurosurgery service overnight for close monitoring and consideration for possible EVD placement. She was started on decadron and received an additional mg Vitamin K . She was briefly started on a nitroprusside drip but this was stopped last night and her BP has subsequently been well-controlled in -'s systolic with additional doses of prn hydralazine. She was extubated last night shortly after arrival to the ICU and has remained stable on L NC. Repeat CT head this appeared stable. As no surgical interventions are currently planned the neurosurgery team requested transfer to neurology for further management. She is currently awake, somewhat lethargic but appropriately arousable. She is able to answer a few yes/no questions and seems to understand that she is in the hospital but is unable to tell us of the events yesterday or why she is here.

She was subsequently transferred to the neurology service on for further management. Neuro: She was monitored closely with Q hour neurochecks and remained clinically stable. Repeat head CT's on and appeared stable. She had initially been started on Decadron for prevention of cerebral edema and mannitol was placed at bedside in case she decompensated secondary to acute cerebral edema. However, pt did well with no edema and decardron was tapered slowly over days. BP was monitored closely and treated with hydralazine and metprolol prn with a goal SBP < . Her exam remained stable, significant for disorientation, dysarthria, and mild nystagmus on leftward gaze but no apparent strength deficits or ataxia (although formal testing somewhat limited by lethargy and poor cooperation. She was initially quite lethargic and disoriented with very delayed responses and nonsensical, garbled speech. She is now becoming more alert and lucid, oriented to self and hospital, and able to answer simple questions appropriately. She remains somewhat abulic with significant psychomotor slowing. At this point the etiology of her hemorrhage is unclear. Possibilities include hypertensive (no known history although BP was / on presentation, underlying mass or AVM,yloid angiopathy, or hemorrhagic conversion of infarction (although does not follow a clear vascular distrubiton. MRI could not be performed due to her pacemaker. CV: She was maintained on telemetry monitoring which revealed atrial fibrillation, occasionally with RVR.

MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Centered within the right cerebellum is a predominantly cystic mm lesion with well-defined borders and a mm enhancing mural component. Additionally, there is enhancement of the capsule/pseudocapsule surrounding the lesion. There is mild-to-moderate surrounding vasogenic edema which extends into the left cerebellar hemisphere and results in complete effacement of the fourth ventricle as well as mass effect on the adjacent medulla. Mild dilatation is noted involving the third and lateral ventricular system with slightly increased FLAIR hyperintensity adjacent to the ventricular horns, which may relate to chronic small vessel disease or acute transependymal flow of CSF. Additional scattered punctate subcortical white matter lesions are noted within the frontal lobes bilaterally, likely related to chronic small vessel disease. There is no region of acute infarction, hemorrhage, or cerebral edema/enhancing lesions identified. Major vascular flow voids appear preserved. IMPRESSION: Predominantly cystic lesion with enhancing rim/pseudocapsule as well as a large enhancing mural nodular component with mild-to-moderate surrounding vasogenic edema resulting in marked mass effect on the adjacent fourth ventricle as well as mild hydrocephalus. Given the patient's history, a cystic metastatic lesion is felt most likely with the differential also including hemangioblastoma.

Intra-abdominal bleeding from the hepatic artery, s/p coil embolization of the hepatic artery. History of Present Illness: Mr. is a year old gentleman who has had two orthotopic liver transplantations. He had a difficult postoperative course, ultimately was in rehabilitation center where he developed shortness of breath and a feeling of being unwell. He presented on and was found to have a left pleural effusion. A small chest tube was placed and cc bloody serosanguineous fluid was aspirated. Subsequent CT scan demonstrated that the fluid collection was loculated. The patient had been intubated due to his respiratory distress. There were no signs of sepsis. He was taken to the OR on for a thoracoscopy to evacuate the pleural fibrin and blood. During the procedure, it was discaocerd that he had trapped lung and, therefore, a limited thoracotomy with partial decortication was performed.

Brief Hospital Course: After his left thoracotomy for left trapped lung, Mr. was transferred back to the ICU. His nutritional status was supported by TPN. He remained on the ventilator for a few days but could be extubated. However, he decompensated shortly thereafter and had to be reintubated. On , he developped a massive GI bleed and he was transported emergently to the cath lab. A fistula was discovered between the previously stented hepatic artery/GDA into his GI tract. The hepatic as well as the gastroduodenal arteries were coiled. Postoperatively, the bleeding subsided. Mr. received multiple blood products to maintain his HCT. He remained on the ventilator for repiratory failure and could not be weaned off. Multiple discussions were held with the family, who decided to make him DNR/DNI.

Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. was evaluated in the Emergency Room by the Trauma service as well as Neurosurgery and subsequently admitted to the Trauma ICU for further evaluation and management. From a neurologic standpoint she was moving both legs randomly and her upper extremities withdrew to pain. Her left pupil was about mm and dilated. her GCS at was and it was up to on admission here. She had limited movement of her left arm but she also had a large hematoma around the left upper arm and shoulder. Her sedation was decreased to attempt to assess her neurologic status however she became too agitated. On she was taken to the Operating Room and underwent a T posterior fusion. She tolerated the procedure well and returned to the ICU in stable condition. In order to protect her airway she had a tracheostomy placed on and was subsequently weaned from the ventilator and maintained on a trach collar. Her neuro status was improving daily. On she was transferred out of the ICU to the Trauma floor where she continued to make slow but steady progress. Her nutrition was initially maintained through a Dobbhoff feeding tube but due to her traumatic brain injury it was unclear how much progress she would make in taking food orally therefore on she was taken back to the Operating Room and underwent a laparoscopic G Tube placement. This was also tolerated well and her tube feedings were resumed on ...Replete with fiber with a goal rate of cc/hour. She was seen by the Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy services daily and was making notable progress. She responds to simple commands. She moves both legs and right arm freely and her left arm is weaker but moves. Her left upper arm hematoma is present but slowly decreasing in size. Her left pupil remains fixed at mm. Her serial scans have showed improvement. Unfortunately she fell out of bed on and was re scanned again including C Spine, Head CT and Torso, all of which were negative. ( see reports above There have been no further incidents of falling. She is in a low boy bed with surrounding padding and her hand restraints have been removed. She will be discharged to an acute neuro rehab today to continue aggressive treatment with the goal of improving her cognition, increasing her mobility and ultimately returning home.

Patient initially presented to OSH on with RUQ abdominal pain and nausea without vomiting. Her labs were significant for WBC ., Tbili ., Dbili .,ylase , lipase , ALT , AST , alk phos , UA positive. Patient had a RUQ ultrasound which showed interval development of mild to moderate biliary dilatation (CBD mm at level ofpulla. Also with mm gallstone in the fundus of the gallbladder. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy which was a difficult procedure and JP drain was left in place. Due to persistently high output and suspicion of bile leak ERCP was attempted to assess for cystic duct leak however unable to cannulate common bile duct. Decision made to transfer patient to for ERCP with biliary stent if there is a cystic duct leak. On presentation here patient reported RUQ pain, described as sharp. Pain steadily worsening. She denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cp, sob or lightheadedness/dizziness. No fever or chills. No po intake since ERCP.

Brief Hospital Course: yo F with CAD, s/p PM, HTN, dyslipidemia, GERD, hx of CVA, tacheomalacia and eosinophilic bronchitis who initially presented to OSH on with cholecystitis now s/p lap chole with complicated surgery requiring JP drain presented in transfer with concern for bile leak. Cholecystitis s/p lap chole: On admission, patient with abdominal pain and increased JP drain output concerning for bile leak. Pt was initially admitted to Medicine, and the ERCP team was consulted. She underwent successful ERCP with placement of a plastic stent, which relieved the biliary leak. Following the procedure, pt developed acute respiratory distress and hypoxia. CXR was concerning for acute pulmonary edema. She was treated with lasix for diuresis and she was transferred to the ICU for further care. In the ICU, patient was noted to have free air under the diaphragm and was evaluated by surgery for urgent OR. However, given stable abdominal exam with no evidence of acute abdomen, and temporal relationship to lap chole, air was attributed to recent surgery and no intervention was necessary. Her breathing rapidly stabilized (see below. Abdominal exam improved with tenderness around JP drain resolving steadily after ERCP and at discharge had only slight tenderness around drain with movement. Surgery consult recommended JP drain removal be performed as an outpatient by her primary surgeon. She was initially treated with vanc/zosyn, though this was changed to cipro/flagyl as exam remained stable. Her diet was gradually advanced, which she tolerated well. She was discharged with plan to complete two more day of ciprofloxacin/metronidazole for a total course of days after biliary stent placement. Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Patient was transferred to ICU on after developing sudden respiratory distress on the floor in the setting of elevated BP (presumed catecholamine surge. Pt was diuresed with lasix boluses with significant improvement in her respiratory status. She was weaned off the facemask and maintained her saturation on nasal canula. Home blood pressure medications were restarted and she was euvolemic on transfer out of the ICU. Echocardiogram showed normal EF, mild AS. Furosemide was stopped and she was weaned off supplemental oxygen with no further respiratory distress. Atrial fibrillation: Pt has history of previous AF and was on coumadin but stopped some time prior to admission in the context of severe GI bleed. After discussion with PCP and cardiologist pt is usually in sinus and during hospitalization had a brief episode of well rate controlled AF that converted back to sinus. Given history of severe bleeding coumadin will be discussed further as an outpatient but held for now. This was decided in discussion with PCP and stroke risk was discussed with patient and husband. Aspirin and diltiazem were continued. Diarrhea: Patient had diarrhea after being transferred out of the MICU but this was low volume and not associated with fever, leukocytosis or other symptoms. C diff was negative and this began to improve after solid food was restarted. Likely due to functional hypermotility and liquid diet. GERD: She was continued on her her home PPI Eosinophilic bronchitis: She was continued on her home fluticasone-salmeterol inhaler and albuterol PRN CAD s/p CABG: She never had signs or symptoms of ACS. She was continued on her home ASA and diltiazem. Simvastatin was held at admission then restarted at discharge. HTN, benign: She was hypertensive post procedure but then blood pressures were well controlled on home regimen of diltiazem andlodipine. History of cerebrovascular disease: Blood pressure control was continued with dilt andlodipine. Her aspirin was similarly continued. Glaucoma: She was continued on her home cyclosporin drops. The patient tolerated a full diet prior to discharge. She received heparin SC for DVT prophylaxis. She was full code. Transitional Issues: - She will be discharged to acute rehab given deconditioning and poor exercise tolerance for PT - She will follow up with Dr. , her surgeon, regarding removal of her JP drain - She should have an MRCP as an outpatient to evaluate a possible pancreatic cyst seen on in house CT scan - She will follow up with Dr. , her cardiologist, for further management of her diastolic heart failure and CAD - She will follow up with Dr. in wks for repeat ERCP and evaluation of need for more stents vs stent removal - Doctors and continue to manage patient's atrial fibrillation and discuss/ weigh risks and benefits of anticoagulation with the family Medications on Admission: Outpatient Medications: Diltiazem ER mg daily Protonix mg Advair / Norvasc .mg daily ASA Vit D IU daily MVI Vit C mg daily Simvastatin mg daily Gelnique Sachets % gel q evening Restasis gtt ea eye Tylenol prn .

Upon admission to MICU, the patient appeared in pain. The patient's BP normalized after L. Hypotension was thought secondary to morphinedinistration in the ED. He was afebrile with negative cardiac enzymes. It was unclear where his source of bleeding was but the patient was guaiac negative. His thigh had been firm and it was suspected that he may a hematoma there. He remained hemodynamically stable and was thought appropriate for transfer to medicine. He was transferred to the medicine floor on and taken for surgery on , where he underwent ORIF of his left hip. He went to the SICU post-op to recover, as he was transiently hypotensive during the procedure. His SICU course included UTI and post op ileus (see below. On he was called out to the medicine floor. He continued to have a largeount of serous fluid drain from the traction wounds in his knee. His Hct remained stable in the low s. Ortho recommendations were to continue weight beairng as tolerated, lovenox for DVT prophylaxis and tylenol for pain. He should follow up in two weeks in ortho clinic with , NP. Abdominal distension/ileus: In the MICU the patient was found to have a mildly distended abdomen that was soft and non tender, with an unclear baseline. It was noted in the records that the patient required agressive bowel regimen at rehab it was thought that he had chronic constipation and was given an aggressive bowel regimen. After the patient went to the OR he developed a post op ileus confirmed by KUB and had an NGT placed to suction. He had a rectal tube placed for decompression but this failed. On PO D he was started on PPN for nutrition. GI was consulted and they felt this was a pseudoobstruction. They recommended continued NG suction, avoiding narcotics and anticholinergics, and changing his position every hour. He should have a daily KUB and if his colon diameter is between - cm, surgery should be consulted because this is a surgical emergency. It was .cm on , and unchanged on .
